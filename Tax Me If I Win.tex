\subsection{Survey ``Beliefs climate policies''\label{subsec:Survey-Beliefs-climate}}

\subsubsection{Survey Data Collection }

The 3002 responses were collected in February and March 2019 through
the survey company Bilendi. This company maintains a panel of French
respondents whom they can email with survey links. Respondents are
paid 2.50¤ if they fully complete the survey. The respondents who
choose to respond are first channeled through some screening questions
that ensure that the final sample is representative along six socio-demographic
characteristics: gender, age (5 brackets), education (4), socio-professional
category (8), size of town (5) and region (9). The quotas are relaxed
by 5\% to 10\% relative to actual proportions. Table 1 confirms that
our sample is very representative. Nonetheless, observations are thus
weighted to correct small differences between sample and population
proportions. The median time for completion of the survey was 19 minutes.

\subsubsection{The Survey }

The full survey in French can be seen \href{https://hbs.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9zqdJWZXgpWfjsF}{on-line}.\footnote{\href{http://hbs.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9zqdJWZXgpWfjsF}{hbs.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_9zqdJWZXgpWfjsF}}
It contains several random branches and treatments that are independent
from one another.

\paragraph{Priming On Environmental Issues}

Two blocks of information are randomly displayed or not: one on climate
change and the other of particulate matter. This priming divides the
sample in four groups, who received either one block of information,
the other, none or both of them. Climate change information includes
temperature trends for long run future, worrying facts on current
and expected impacts, and a claim that keeping global warming below
2°C is technically feasible. Particulate information consists in the
estimated impact on French mortality (48,000 deaths per year), life
expectancy (9 months less), and the assertion that reducing fuel consumption
would improve health. The time spent on each block is saved, and links
to scientific references are provided to support the information.

\paragraph{Household Characteristics}

In addition to the quotas strata, socio-demographic characteristics
include zip code, household structure, income of the respondent and
of their household. Energetic characteristics contain questions that
allow us to estimate the impact of a carbon tax increase on housing
expenditures: surface of accommodation, heating type (collective or
individual) and energy source; as well as on transport expenditures:
number of vehicles, type(s) of fuel, distance traveled last year and
average fuel economy. The distributions of answers are much in-line
with official statistics. TODO

\paragraph{Partial Tax Reforms}

To study the perception of different indirect taxes, respondents are
first asked using a Likert scale whether they would loose more or
less purchasing power than the average French household through an
increase of the VAT tax (where both additional rate and usage of the
revenues remain unspecified). Then, one partial tax reform is randomly
allocated to the respondent: it consists in an increase of the carbon
tax by 50¤/t$\text{CO}_{2}$ specific either to heating fuel and gas,
or to gasoline and diesel. Partial reforms on housing and transport
feature the same questions. Similarly to the VAT question, it starts
with the relative loss of purchasing power. Then, we specify in a
new block that the revenues of the tax would be distributed equally
to each adult, entailing a yearly transfer of 50¤ (resp. 60¤) for
the partial tax on housing (resp. transport). We also provide the
price increases implied by the tax: +13\% (resp. +15\%) for gas (resp.
domestic fuel) on the one hand, and +0.11¤ (resp. +0.13¤) for a liter
of gasoline (resp. diesel) on the other. Then, we ask the respondent
whether their household would win, loose or be unaffected by the reform,
and further ask them to estimate their subjective gain or loss among
5 or 6 intervals. The interval thresholds are tailored to each respondent,
as they are computed in proportion of the number of consumption units
of their household (as defined by \href{http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:Equivalised_disposable_income}{Eurostat}).
Finally, respondents are asked to estimate their own elasticity as
well as that of French people. To this end, we borrow the phrasing
of \citet{baranzini_effectiveness_2017}, and ask the expected decrease
in consumption that would follow a 30\% increase in the price of heating
(or equivalently, an increase of 0.50¤ in fuel prices), among 5 brackets. 

\paragraph{Compensated Carbon Tax Increase}

\subparagraph{Perceptions \emph{ex ante}}

Our main reform of interest is an increase by 50¤/t$\text{CO}_{2}$
of the French carbon tax, that concerns both housing and transport.
Its revenues redistributed equally, so that each adult receives a
yearly compensation of 110¤. This amount was computed using the estimations
of \citet{douenne_vertical_2019} for the elasticity: $-0.4$ for
transport and $-0.2$ for housing, as well as an incidence borne at
80\% by the consumers. After describing the reform, a first block
of questions elicits the respondent's perceptions. Their subjective
gain is asked in the same manner than for the partial tax. The priming
that ``scientists agree that a carbon tax would be effective in reducing
pollution'' is randomly displayed or not before asking whether the
reform would be effective in reducing pollution and fighting climate
change. Then, respondents are asked to pick the categories of losers
and winners. Finally, we ask: ``Would you approve this reform?''
and let the respondent choose between ``Yes'', ``No'' or ``PNR
(I don't know, I don't want to answer)''. In the following, we say
that a respondent \emph{approve }a reform if they respond ``Yes'',
and that they \emph{accept} the reform if they do \emph{not} respond
``No''. Given the low rates of approval, we study primarily the
acceptance to get tighter confidence intervals.

\subparagraph{Opinion \emph{after knowledge}}

To test the persistence of beliefs and measure the importance of self-interest
and fairness motives in the acceptance of the reform, we provide some
information on the effect of the reform. To a random half of the sample,
we explain that ``this reform would increase the purchasing power
of the poorest households and decrease that of the richest, who consume
more energy''. To two-thirds of the respondents (the remaining half
plus one third of the respondent with the priming on \emph{progressivity}),
we tell that: ``In five cases over six, a household with your characteristics
would {[}win/loose{]} through the reform. (The characteristics taken
into account are: heating using {[}energy source{]} for an accommodation
of {[}surface{]} m$^{2}$; {[}distance{]} km traveled with an average
consumption of {[}fuel economy{]} L for 100 km.)''. Indeed, section
\ref{subsec:Consumer-survey-Budget} shows that we estimate correctly
if a household wins or loose in 83\% of cases. 

During the survey collection, we understood that most respondents
did not believe the claim that the reform was progressive, so we asked
to the second half of the sample whether they thought it was, to analyze
the effects of priming on these compliant respondents. We also ask
again the winning category (i.e. if the respondent's household would
win, loose or be unaffected by the reform) and the approval to the
reform. Finally, we let the respondent pick the reasons why this reform
seems beneficial, and undesirable. TODO: stats des

\paragraph{Tax Increase with Targeted Compensation}

In this block, we ask for the winning category and for the approval
of four alternative reforms. Each respondent deals with just one of
them, which differ from the main reform only in the way revenues are
recycled. Here, the payments, still equal among recipients, are targeted
to adults whose income is below some threshold. The four threshold
correspond to the bottom 20\%, 30\%, 40\% and 50\% of the income distribution.
They are computed using inflated deciles of individual income from
the \emph{Enquête sur les Revenus Socio-Fiscaux }(ERFS 2014) produced
by \emph{INSEE }(the French national statistics bureau).\footnote{Incomes entitled to the household rather to its members, such as certain
welfare benefits, are divided equally among the two oldest adults
of the household.} Respondents whose income lies between two thresholds are allocated
randomly to a reform featuring one of them. When the income is close
to only one threshold (i.e. when its percentile in the distribution
is below 20 or within $\left[50;70\right]$), the reform allocated
corresponds to that one. When the respondent's income is above 2220¤/month
(which is the 70th. percentile), the reform they face is determined
by the income of their spouse. Finally, when both (or the only one)
adults in the household earn more than 2220¤/month, their reform is
allocated randomly between the four variants. Table \ref{tab:Compensation-amount-by}
describes the targeted reforms and the proportion of respondents allocated
to each of them, along with the proportion one would expect from the
\emph{ERFS}. The two sets of figures matches almost perfectly, indicating
that our sample is representative along the income dimension.

\end{tabular}

reform by target of the payment.}

\end{table}


\paragraph{Other Questions}

We do not detail the other questions of the survey, because we analyze
them in a companion paper. TODO:ref We scrutinize opinions on environmental
policies, including other ways to recycle the revenues of a carbon
tax. We measure the knowledge and perceptions of climate change; ask
some specific questions over shale gas, over the influence of climate
change on the choice to give birth and on willingness to change one's
lifestyle. We study the use, availability and satisfaction with public
transportation and active mobility. We ask political preferences,
including the positioning in relation to \emph{yellow vests}. Finally,
we let the respondent express any comment in a text box.

\subsubsection{Ensuring Data Quality }

We took several steps to ensure the best possible data quality. We
excluded the 2\% of respondents who spend less than 7 minutes on the
full survey. We confirm that response time is not significantly correlated
with our variable of interest (such as approval or subjective gain).
In order to screen out inattentive respondents, a test of quality
of the responses was inserted, which asked to select ``A little''
on a Likert scale. The 9\% of respondents who failed the test were
also excluded from our final sample of 3002 respondents. Also, when
the questions about a reform were spread over different pages, we
recalled the details of the reform on each new page. We check for
careless or strange answers on numerical questions, such as income
or the size of the household. We flag 10 respondents with aberrant
answers to the size of the household (above 12) and up to 246 respondents
with incorrect answers, such as a size of household smaller than the
number of adults, or a household income smaller than individual income.
An examination of these answers shows no significant correlation with
our variables of interest, and suggests that these respondents have
simply mistaken the question (e.g. they may have confounded the zip
code with the household size, or household income with individual
income). Also, 58 respondents have answered more than 10,000¤ as their
monthly income (despite the word ``monthly'' being in bold and underlined),
with answers in the typical range of French incomes. We have divided
these figures by 12.
