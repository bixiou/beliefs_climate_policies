Before starting, please read carefully the information below on particulate
matter pollution: 
\end{enumerate}
\begin{itemize}
\item particulate matter are responsible for 48,000 deaths in France each
year; 
\item particulate matter reduce the life expectancy of French people by
9 months; 
\item reducing fuel consumption would reduce the health problems associated
with particulate matter. \\

\item {[}Info CC{]} Welcome to this survey. \\
It was conceived by two researchers in social science. It lasts about
15-20 minutes.\\
\\
Please read carefully the information below on climate change. \\
\end{enumerate}
\begin{itemize}
\item Climate change is already responsible for 150,000 deaths annually.
\item If greenhouse gas emissions continue on their current trend, the average
global warming will be +5°C in 2100 and +8°C in 2250. 
\item A rapid transition to renewable energies is technically possible and
would contain global warming at +2°C. 
\end{itemize}
According to scientists, in the absence of ambitious measures: 
\begin{itemize}
\item a large proportion of species face an increased risk of extinction;
\item natural disasters will intensify (hurricanes, heat waves, droughts,
floods, forest fires, etc.); 
\item by 2100, 270 million more people would be flooded each year due to
sea-level rise; 
\item violent conflicts and migration flows can be expected to increase. 
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Tax \& targeted dividend}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The government is studying an increase in the carbon tax, whose revenues
would be redistributed \textbf{\uline{to the {[}20 / 30 / 40 /
50{]}\% of the poorest French people only}}. This would imply: 
\end{enumerate}
\begin{itemize}
\item an increase in the price of gasoline by 11 cents per liter and diesel
by 13 cents per liter; 
\item an increase of 13\% in the price of gas, and 15\% in the price of
heating oil;

\item no compensation for the others. 
\end{itemize}
We estimate that in your household, {[}number of recipients{]} persons

\\
In terms of purchasing power, would your household win or lose with
such a measure? \emph{}\\
\emph{Win; Be unaffected; Lose}
\begin{enumerate}

about 20 times more greenhouse gases by plane than by high speed train. }
\item In your opinion, how would the effects of climate change be, if humanity
did nothing to limit it? \emph{}\\
\emph{Insignificant, or even beneficial; Small, because humans would
be able to live with it; Grave, because there would be more natural
disasters; Disastrous, lifestyles would be largely altered; Cataclysmic,
humankind would disappear; PNR(Don't know, don't say) }
\item In which of these two regions do you think will climate change have
the worst consequences? \emph{}\\

\item In your opinion, who is responsible for climate change? (Several possible
choices) \emph{}\\
\emph{Each of us; The richest; Governments; Some foreign countries;
Past generations; Natural causes }
\item Currently, each French person emits on average the equivalent of 10

\item {[}If \emph{Yes}{]} Why does climate change influence your decision
to have a child (or children)? (Several answers possible). \emph{}\\

means; Yes, if everyone did the same; No, only the richest people

change, notably through a transition to renewable energy, through
efforts of the richest, and imagining that France would expand the

\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Shale gas (and miscellaneous)}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Do you smoke regularly? \emph{Yes; No }
\item The use of shale gas would limit climate change, as gas would be exported
and used to produce electricity instead of coal. On the other hand,
extraction would risk reducing water quality at the local level. Your
department {[}would be / would not be{]} concerned by the exploitation
of shale gas. \\
\\
In view of this information, would you be in favor of shale gas exploitation
in France? \emph{}\\
\emph{Yes; No; PNR (Don't know, don't say) }
\item What would be the main benefit to you from shale gas development?
\emph{}\\
\emph{This would limit climate change; This would create jobs and
boost the department; None of these two reasons }
\item What do you think of the idea that shale gas would limit climate change?
\emph{}\\

It is unwelcome: emissions should be stopped, not just slowed down;

\emph{Less than three times a day; Between four times a day and once
an hour; Once or twice an hour; More than three times an hour; PNR
(Don't know, don't say) }
\item What do you think about the availability of public transport where

\emph{Television; Press (written or online); Social networks; Radio;
Other}
\item What do you think of the Yellow Vests? (Several answers possible)
\emph{}\\
\emph{I am part of them; I support them; I understand them; I oppose
them; PNR (Don't know, don't say) }

\paragraph{International redistribution, preferred budget}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Would you approve the transfer of 2\% of French income to development
aid for poor countries? \emph{Yes; No; PNR (Don't know, don't say) }
\item {[}If \emph{not ``Yes}''{]} {[}For information, rich countries currently
transfer 0.3\% of their income to poor countries' development assistance
(source: \href{http://data.oecd.org/fr/oda/apd-nette.htm}{OECD}).{]}\\
\\
Why do you not agree with the previous proposal? (Several answers
possible) \emph{}\\
\emph{Poor countries will do better on their own than with our help;
Public spending should be used primarily for public services and the
French; I would be in favor if the aid went directly to the poorest,
and not to the States; I would be in favor if all rich countries contributed
as much as France; I would be in favor with a smaller amount: 2\%
is too important }
\item The sliders below allow you to \textbf{express your wishes regarding
the evolution of public spending} by 2022. \\
\\
For example, if you move the Health System slider one notch to the
right, you will see that the health budget increases by +1\%, to ¤243
billion (¤bn), and the total expenditure adjusts accordingly, it increases
by +0.2\%, to ¤1054 billion. \\
\\
\textbf{A slider also controls the level of revenues} (i.e. taxes):
when government revenues increase, the deficit decreases, and vice
versa. A variation in income may result in a tax variation for all
French people, or only for a particular group. To simplify, we do
not ask you to detail which groups would be affected by the fiscal
policy you want. {[}Then, interactive graphics reproduced on: \href{http://adrien-fabre.com/simulateur_depenses_old.php}{adrien-fabre.com/simulateur\_depenses\_old.php}{]}
