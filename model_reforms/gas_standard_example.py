# Here we construct a very standard exemple to study the tax incidence on one consumer
# consuming 1000â‚¬ of natural gas per year, and not having a car.

# The case of natural gas is complicated since it is composed of a two-part tariff (fixed price plus price per unit)
# As a result, this energy is subject to about 4 different taxes (TIC, VAT, CTA, TICGN wichich itself includes CSPG and CTSSG)

# Need to change incorrect parameter values / in particular, determine which vat rate applies, and what are the other taxes levied on consumption
# Note that maybe we don't care if these taxes are not earned by the government

# Check current parameters are correct, in particular that there is no mistake between kWh and MWh
