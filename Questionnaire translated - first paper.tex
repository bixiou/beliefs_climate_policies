It was conceived by two researchers in social science. It lasts about
15-20 minutes.
\item {[}Info PM{]} Welcome to this survey. \\

\\
Before starting, please read carefully the information below on particulate
matter pollution: 
\end{enumerate}
\begin{itemize}
\item particulate matter are responsible for 48,000 deaths in France each
year; 
\item particulate matter reduce the life expectancy of French people by
9 months; 
\item reducing fuel consumption would reduce the health problems associated
with particulate matter. \\

\item {[}Info CC{]} Welcome to this survey. \\
It was conceived by two researchers in social science. It lasts about
15-20 minutes.\\
\\
Please read carefully the information below on climate change. \\
\end{enumerate}
\begin{itemize}
\item Climate change is already responsible for 150,000 deaths annually.
\item If greenhouse gas emissions continue on their current trend, the average
global warming will be +5°C in 2100 and +8°C in 2250. 
\item A rapid transition to renewable energies is technically possible and
would contain global warming at +2°C. 
\end{itemize}
According to scientists, in the absence of ambitious measures: 
\begin{itemize}
\item a large proportion of species face an increased risk of extinction;
\item natural disasters will intensify (hurricanes, heat waves, droughts,
floods, forest fires, etc.); 
\item by 2100, 270 million more people would be flooded each year due to
sea-level rise; 
\item violent conflicts and migration flows can be expected to increase. 
\end{itemize}

taken into account are: heating with {[}source{]} for a dwelling of
{[}size{]} m\texttwosuperior ; {[}distance{]} km covered with an average

\emph{Winner; Unaffected; Loser} 
\begin{enumerate}
\item {[}Info on progressivity{]} On average, this measure would increase
the purchasing power of poorest households, and decrease that of the

\emph{Yes; No; PNR (Don't know, don't say)}
\item {[}No info on progressivity{]} Do you think this measure would benefit
the poorest?\\

\item In view of the above estimate, would you approve of such a measure?
\emph{}\\
\emph{Yes; No; PNR (Don't know, don't say)} 
\item Why do you think this measure is beneficial? (Maximum three responses)
\emph{}\\
\emph{Contributes to the fight climate change; Reduces the harmful
effects of pollution on health; Reduces traffic congestion; Increases
my purchasing power; Increases the purchasing power of the poorest;
Fosters France's independence from fossil energy imports; Prepares
the economy for tomorrow's challenges; For none of these reasons;
Other (specify): }
\item Why do you think this measure is unwanted? (Maximum three answers)
\emph{}\\
\emph{Is ineffective in reducing pollution; Alternatives are insufficient
or too expensive; Penalizes rural areas; Decreases my purchasing power;
Decreases the purchasing power of some modest households; Harms the
economy and employment; Is a pretext for raising taxes; For none of
these reasons; Other (specify):}

\paragraph{Tax \& targeted dividend}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The government is studying an increase in the carbon tax, whose revenues
would be redistributed \textbf{\uline{to the {[}20 / 30 / 40 /
50{]}\% of the poorest French people only}}. This would imply: 
\end{enumerate}
\begin{itemize}
\item an increase in the price of gasoline by 11 cents per liter and diesel
by 13 cents per liter; 
\item an increase of 13\% in the price of gas, and 15\% in the price of
heating oil; 
\item an annual payment of {[}550 / 360 / 270 / 220{]}¤ for each adult earning
less than {[}780 / 1140 / 1430 / 1670{]}¤ per month (welfare benefits
included, before withholding tax); 
\item no compensation for the others.
