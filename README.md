# beliefs_climate_policies
This is a research project on beliefs regarding climate change and climate policies, in particular with respect to their distributive effects


# To do:
    # Do the matching with ENTD to correct heterogeneity in transport fuel consumption
    # Create the scripts to run the simulations
    # Create a set of elasticities to apply
    # Update inflators


# What we want
    # Estimate average gains/losses from carbon tax reforms by :
        i) income group
        ii) residential area
        iii) heating mode
        iv) age
        v) ?
    # Estimate the share of winners/losers within these groups
    # Estimate the full distribution of gains ans losses within these groups
