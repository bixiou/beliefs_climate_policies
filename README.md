# To do:
    # Change color graphs
    # Include gas in the policy
    # Update parameters for natural gas
    # Update inflators (expenditures and quantities) : current values are arbitrary / imprecise
    # Update prices and taxes : current values are arbitrary / imprecise
    # Add VAT reform
    # For different vehicle types, split between diesel and gasoline to compute tax incidence
    # Create a script to go directly from hh information to expect loss from matching
