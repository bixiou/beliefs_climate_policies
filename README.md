# beliefs_climate_policies
This is a research project on beliefs regarding climate change and climate policies, in particular with respect to their distributive effects


# To do:
    # Update inflators (expenditures and quantities) : current values are arbitrary / imprecise
    # Update prices : current values are arbitrary / imprecise
    # Create a set of heteroregenous elasticities to apply
    # Compute reform cost (in expenditures) for all households
    # Test alternative revenue-recycling scenarios (the one proposed in the questionnaire)
