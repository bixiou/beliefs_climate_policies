","IncidenceRateQ":"What is the survey incidence rate?","IncidenceRateA":"Survey Incidence Rate is the ratio of good completes (or respondents who successfully finished your survey) over the number of total responses. Flagging a response as \u2018Screen-Out\u2019 or \u2018Quota Met\u2019  will decrement the survey incidence rate.  This is done using the Flag Response feature in the End of Survey options. The \u2018Quota Met\u2019 flag is set automatically when the quota action is \u2018End Current Survey.\u2019  The \u2018Screen-Out\u2019 flag is set when using the \u2019Screen-Out Response\u2019 feature, or when \u2018Do not record survey response\u2019 is selected in the End of Survey options.

An easy way of doing it is by timing a few test responses, and taking an average.  We have also found that 10 Seconds for a Multiple Choice question and each row of a Matrix question, and 30 seconds for each text entry box produce a fairly accurate representation.","EndSurveyOptionsQ":"Why are end of survey options ignored for Sample Finder Respondents?","EndSurveyOptionsA":"Each Sample Finder respondent will be automatically redirected to our sample-provider\u2019s website and all survey termination options will be ignored. This includes end of survey messages, redirects, individual response reports, public reports, and scoring summaries.","QuotasQ":"How do survey quotas work with sample finder?","QuotasA":"Quotas continue to work as expected. However, if you have a quota in your survey that doesn\u2019t correspond to a Sample Finder distribution, respondents from the sample finder distribution who terminate prematurely due to a full quota will count against the survey incidence.  Sample Finder is limited on the criteria you can chose from and only allows you to select Gender, Age and Country.

These responses are flagged as preview responses, and may be removed from the View Results section. Additionally, the panel widget allows you to start and pause a distribution at any time. So you can turn it on, collect a few responses, then pause it.
