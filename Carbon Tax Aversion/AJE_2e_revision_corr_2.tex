The French government initially committed to an ambitious trajectory for the price of carbon.\footnote{Specifically, the ``Contribution Climat-Énergie'' is a \textit{sectoral} carbon tax specific to fossil fuels.} Initiated in 2014 at 7\euro{}/tCO$_\textnormal{2}$, the French carbon tax reached 44.6\euro{}/tCO$_\textnormal{2}$ in 2018 and was supposed to continue growing to reach 86.2\euro{}/tCO$_\textnormal{2}$ by 2022. However, at the end of 2018, the same government that had accelerated the price trajectory decided to abandon it and froze the tax at its current level for an undetermined period of time. This turnaround in French climate policy is the direct consequence of the popular protest by the ``Yellow Vests'', which started in opposition to the carbon tax.\footnote{Following a massive \href{https://www.change.org/p/pour-une-baisse-des-prix-\%C3\%A0-la-pompe-essence-diesel}{petition} against rising gasoline prices in November 2018, hundreds of thousands of people started protesting. They wore recognizable fluorescent clothing, gathered at roundabouts and toll booths every day and demonstrated in Paris each Saturday. The Yellow Vests expressed a general concern over their purchasing power and discontent with French elites and institutions.} %%EDITOR'S NOTE: Please ensure that the above revision to "toll booths" maintains the intended meaning. 
Among several factors, the negative impact of the tax on households' purchasing power has certainly been a key driver of public discontent. The increasing revenues from the carbon tax were mostly used to fund the budget rather than redistributed to households, raising concerns over the distributive effects of the policy. To tackle the negative impact of carbon taxation on households' purchasing power, economists have proposed a scheme known as ``tax \& dividend'', i.e., a carbon tax whose revenue is redistributed uniformly to each adult. 3,354 American economists recently supported this strategy in \href{https://www.clcouncil.org/media/EconomistsStatement.pdf}{The Wall Street Journal} ``To maximize the fairness and political viability of a rising carbon tax''. Therefore, an implicit assumption is that with a design that ensures that the properties of the tax are aligned with people's \textit{preferences}, one should be able to generate support for it. However, is this truly sufficient? In this paper, we show that to understand the link between the properties of a policy and its support, one has to account for a critical ingredient: \textit{beliefs}.

% dr2 : "expected to benefit from this policy" -> "expected to benefit from this reform".

The objective of this paper is to understand how the beliefs regarding a policy form and then determine the attitudes towards it. Recent events undoubtedly make the French carbon tax an interesting case study. To explain French attitudes towards carbon taxation, we surveyed a representative sample of 3,002 French households. We focus on a carbon ``tax \& dividend'' policy, i.e., an increase in the carbon tax by 50\euros{}/t$\text{CO}_{2}$, the revenue of which is redistributed uniformly to each adult. Our reform allows one to clearly specify the distributive effects of the policy, in contrast to the one abandoned by the government. Only 10\% of respondents approve of the reform, and 70\% disapprove of it (the rest do not know or do not want to answer). We analyze the perceptions of three well-known determinants of the acceptance of a carbon tax: the impact on one's purchasing power, the progressivity of the scheme, and the scheme’s environmental effectiveness. We compare the subjective beliefs regarding the impacts on one's purchasing power to the objective distribution computed using official household survey data. This comparison shows that people largely overestimate the incidence of the tax on their household. For instance, while 70\% of households are expected to benefit from this reform, only 14\% think that they would. Similarly, while the scheme proposed in our survey is progressive, a large majority of individuals perceive it as regressive. In addition, a majority of respondents do not believe that such a policy would reduce pollution and combat climate change. Using information reported on their energy equipment and usage, we are able to compute a respondent-specific estimate of the tax incidence on their purchasing power. This estimation enables us to examine the heterogeneity in what we call \textit{biases} about the perceived tax incidence. We find that the people most opposed to the policy, and in particular those that support the Yellow Vests, are the most biased, i.e., the most inclined to overestimate their losses. Thus, one may wonder whether pessimistic beliefs lead to policy rejection or the causality runs in the opposite direction.

% dr2 : "strongly supportive of motivated reasoning" -> "consistent with motivated reasoning"

% daej footnote: Motivated reasoning is a type of confirmation bias; it is the ``...'' (ou bien caser confirmation bias ailleurs, e.g. dans le paragraphe MR) -> je pense pas que Ã§a soit nÃ©cessaire, c'est risquÃ© d'en parler sans Ã©laborer, et on explique dÃ©jÃ  bien le fonctionnement donc les lecteurs intÃ©ressÃ©s par le lien entre les deux pourront comprendre. MÃªme la littÃ©rature spÃ©cialisÃ©e MR ne mentionne pas souvent le confirmation bias. => moi je trouve Ã§a vraiment important pour deux raisons : 1. mot-clÃ© dans google scholar, 2. beaucoup de gens nous ont fait la remarque que c'Ã©tait comme le confirmation bias (notion qu'ils connaissaient, pas comme MR) -> pourquoi pas, est-ce que tu prÃ©fÃ¨res en parler en intro ou dans la section 4 ? => je suis indiffÃ©rent de oÃ¹ on le case -> Je trouve que le mieux serait de l'ajouter Ã  la suite de la footnote dans laquelle on dÃ©finit le MR. On pourrait ajouter : "This psychological mechanism can be a driver of the well-known ``confirmation bias''." => ok done
To disentangle the effect of initial beliefs on attitudes towards the policy from the reverse effect of attitudes on perceptions, we investigate the effect of providing new information to respondents through random treatments. Respondents randomly receive (or do not receive) a piece of information about the progressivity and/or the effectiveness of the policy as well as customized information---derived from our respondent-specific estimation---on whether their household is expected to win or lose from the policy. We also specify that this latter information is correct in five cases out of six, a probability that we carefully estimated out-of-sample. Our first observation is that our treatments generally fail to change pessimistic beliefs. For example, among those who would benefit from the reform despite pessimistically believing that they would not, only 12\% are convinced that they would gain when we disclose our estimation to them. Even worse, respondents revise their beliefs in an asymmetric way, giving more weight to new information when it shows that they would lose from the reform, i.e., when it provides them with arguments against the tax. We also find evidence consistent with motivated reasoning\footnote{Motivated reasoning is the ``tendency to find arguments in favor of conclusions we want to believe to be stronger than arguments for conclusions we do not want to believe'' \citep{ziva_kunda_case_1990}. This psychological mechanism can be a driver of the well-known ``confirmation bias''} in the formation of beliefs since those who already approved of the reform are more likely to correctly revise their beliefs, while those most opposed to it such as supporters of the Yellow Vests tend to discard new information unless it goes against the tax. Moreover, we find that this phenomenon is accentuated among highly educated people, suggesting that it stems from an adaptive advantage rather than a cognitive deficiency.

%%% TO AJE : "among those who benefit from the reform when they pessimistically believe that they would lose" : does "when" correctly conveys the meaning that these people both benefit AND think they don't?
%%EDITOR: I have revised this phrase to "despite pessimistically believing that they would not" to more strongly emphasize your meaning.

% sss there are several pieces of information, hence several instruments. So "as an instrument" should be "as instruments". %% RCP NOTE: Edited.
We use the randomly displayed information as instruments to estimate the causal effect of holding certain beliefs (measured as binary variables) on policy support. In the case of self-interest (taken as one's beliefs about winning or losing purchasing power from the policy), we supplement these treatments by testing the support for a different policy, a tax \& \textit{targeted} dividend; people become eligible for this dividend when their incomes are below a certain threshold, and we vary the threshold across respondents to create exogenous variations in eligibility. The method we use in this case is noteworthy since it creates random variation in the beliefs of winning around the eligibility thresholds and enables us to estimate the causal effect of this belief using a fuzzy regression discontinuity design (RDD). Our results indicate that convincing people of the actual incidence and effectiveness of the policy could lead to majority support. Indeed, we find that self-interest has a large effect on support for the policy: the belief that one does not lose from it increases the acceptance rate by more than 50 p.p. Similarly, believing that the tax is environmentally effective increases the approval rate of the reform by more than 40 p.p. We also provide non-causal evidence that believing in the progressivity of the scheme has a large effect on support. Overall, these results suggest that the rejection of carbon taxation does not typically result from clashing principles, such as a disinterest in the climate or a dislike of price instruments but rather from overly pessimistic beliefs about the properties of the reform. Provided that people's opposition to the policy reinforces their pessimism---which our results suggest---their biases are reinforced such that new information might only further push their attitude in one direction.\footnote{The ``campaign effect'' documented by \citet{anderson_can_2019} (in the case of referenda in Washington state in the US) is an example of how support for a carbon tax can decrease substantially after it enters the public debate. This may explain why the acceptance of an increase in the carbon tax plummeted with the Yellow Vests movement, down from a level of 48\% \citep{ademe_representations_2018} in the middle of the range of that in other countries \citep{brechin_public_2010}. This effect confirms that the French carbon tax may be an insightful case study to understand what could happen in other countries when a controversial policy is publicly debated.} %


%%% TO AJE : "We use the random display of information as an instrument" : we previously had "as instruments", because there are several pieces of information, hence several instruments. With "an instrument", we are afraid people might think that there is only one.

%%EDITOR: I have revised the phrasing to "randomly displayed information as instruments" to clarify that there are multiple instruments to prevent any possible confusion.

%%% TO AJE : "whose compensation targets to people with incomes below a threshold" : "targets to" sounds odd to us, do you confirm that it means that only people whose income is below some threshold are eligible (i.e. targeted by the scheme)?

%EDITOR: "Targets to" is awkward. To better clarify your meaning, this has been revised to "a tax \& \textit{targeted} dividend; people become eligible for this dividend when their incomes are below a certain threshold, and we vary the threshold across respondents to create exogenous variations in eligibility"

%%% TO AJE : "their biases gain momentum" : we are not sure whether the intended meaning is preserved or not. We previously had "gain inertia" to convey the idea that the more opposed, the more pessimistically biased people are, which reinforces their opposition, and so on and so forth. Is this idea preserved with "momentum"?

%EDITOR: I have revised this to "biases are reinforced such that new information might only further push their attitude in one direction". Both "gain inertia" and "gain momentum" could convey your meaning, but I belive this new phrasing does so with less ambiguity. 

%%%TO AJE : "a referendum in Washington state" : we previously had "referenda" because there was several of them, was this incorrect? Is "referendums" preferred?

%EDITOR: You are correct, this has been revised.

% dr2 : "To the extent that beliefs are formed endogenously in a motivated way, people's biases gain inertia" : Conserve t-on cela ? Peut-Ãªtre Ã  reformuler ? => a minima are -> would be et gain -> would gain -> est-ce que "To the extent" convient bien ? => pour prendre plus de prÃ©caution on pourrait dire "According to the suggestive evidence that" ou bien "Providing that" -> "Providing that people form their beliefs endogenously in a motivated way, their biases gain inertia" mais "providing that" est trop faible. Ou bien ajouter "---which our results suggest---" aprÃ¨s "motivated way". => done "Provided that people form their beliefs endogenously in a motivated way---which our results suggest---, their biases gain inertia"

The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it contributes to a recent literature that has emerged to understand the political economy of climate policies since this issue is becoming critical in the public debate. For a thorough review of this literature, we refer the reader to \citet{carattini_overcoming_2018} and suggest the more synthetic \citet{klenert_making_2018}, as well as \citet{millner_beliefs_2016} for a review of the political obstacles to environmental policies. \citet{stern_value_1993} is an early work proposing and testing a model of attitudes on environmental quality intended to disentangle egoistic from altruistic motives on the one hand and beliefs from values on the other hand. Among all possible attitudes, they show that beliefs about consequences for self-interest are the only predictor of the willingness to pay Pigouvian taxes. Using a postelectoral survey in Switzerland, \citet{thalmann_public_2004} also finds a correlation between carbon tax acceptance and self-interest, proxied by the number of cars owned. In surveys on British, Swedish, and Swiss respondents, \citet{bristow_public_2010}, \citet{brannlund_tax_2012}, and \citet{carattini_green_2017}, respectively, document a higher approval rate when the reform addresses distributional issues. \citet{baranzini_effectiveness_2017} report that a majority of the people they interviewed in Geneva do not believe that the tax would be effective, which confirms what \citet{dresner_history_2006} find with focus groups in the UK. Surveying Norwegian people, \citet{kallbekken_saelen_2011} show that self-interest matters for acceptance but less than concerns for environmental effectiveness or distributional effects. Using US data, \citet{anderson_can_2019} argue that ideology explains most of the support for carbon taxation and suggest that this effect would dominate that of self-interest.

% sss we do not assume that people are fully rational or have perfect information => why not "nor" instead of "or"? %% RCP NOTE: Edited.
In the present paper, we also study how acceptance depends on these three motives (i.e., self-interest, perceived environmental effectiveness and progressivity). We contribute to the literature by providing robust evidence for causal effects where past studies essentially show correlations, often relying on proxies such as fuel consumption to proxy for self-interest \citep[e.g.,][]{thalmann_public_2004,kallbekken_saelen_2011,anderson_can_2019}. In contrast, we do not assume that people are fully rational or that they have perfect information. Thus, our methodology offers a novel examination of the political economy of climate policies since it allows one to disentangle erroneous \emph{beliefs} from the pure effects of \emph{preferences}.\footnote{We take preferences over policies as the mapping from beliefs (on facts) to attitudes (on policies), i.e., how attitudes are determined as a function of beliefs. Conversely, motivated reasoning represents the feedback loop from attitudes to beliefs.} The paper also quantifies biases regarding the costs of the carbon tax. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that compares subjective beliefs and objective data about the private costs that arise from carbon taxation. Given the intense public debate over the incidence of such a policy, identifying and measuring the discrepancy between actual impacts and their subjective perception is critical.

%%% TO AJE : "providing robust evidence for the causal effects" : we are talking about different types of causal effects, that are not specifically identified. Is "the" necessary/correct here?

%EDITOR: You are correct; I have removed the definite article. 

%%% TO AJE : "we do not assume that people are fully rational or that they have perfect information" : why is "nor" incorrect here ?

%EDITOR: The use of "do not" makes the use of "nor" here sound awkward. If you wish to use "nor" rather than "or" here, consider "we neither assume that people are fully rational nor that they have perfect information".

% dr2 : revoir le paragraphe ci dessous, le raccourcir et nuancer la portÃ©e de nos rÃ©sultats. Proposition : "Beyond the case of carbon pricing, our paper contributes to the literature on the formation of political beliefs. Recent research has shown how beliefs on inequality and social mobility affect people's attitudes regarding distributive policies \citep[e.g.,][]{cruces_et_al_2013,kuziemko_et_al_2015,alesina_intergenerational_2018}. Our paper expands this literature by investigating the relationship between beliefs and attitudes on climate policies. Indeed, using a representative survey, our paper shows how beliefs towards a policy causally impact attitudes towards it. It also shows that attitudes towards a policy can be linked to the way new infomation about it is processed. Among other possible mechanisms, our results are consistent with theories of motivated reasoning (\citet{ziva_kunda_case_1990}; see \citet{benabou_mindful_2016} for a recent review) that have thus far been mostly tested in the lab \citep[e.g.,][]{redlawsk_hot_2002,thaler_2019}. In particular, our results support the recent theory of \citet{little_distortion_2019}, who formalizes motivated reasoning as a way to reconcile an auxiliary belief (one's self-interest in the reform) to a core belief (here, policy rejection)." -> (peut-Ãªtre sans la derniÃ¨re phrase sur Little). => ok, en gardant derniÃ¨re phrase. Peut-Ãªtre "side with" au lieu de "support". Mais du coup on parle plus de tax aversion ? Pourquoi mais faut changer le titre dans ce cas. -> Je ne sais pas comment conserver la rÃ©fÃ©rence Ã  ce terme sans survendre nos rÃ©sultats sur cet aspect. => Pour moi les 3 endroits qui posent pb c'est "our paper provides evidence consistent with theories of motivated reasoning" (que tu changes dÃ©jÃ ), "our results support the recent theory" et "We believe that our results". Le dernier on peut le changer par "Our results might" et je trouve que la partie sur tax aversion serait dite avec suffisamment de prÃ©caution. Et remplacer "support" par "side with" peut ptet suffire pour le 2Ã¨, mais ptet que c'est encore trop survendu. Je viens de voir qu'il dit de garder que une ou deux phrases. Je conserverais la fin, pour garder le titre : "Building upon our results, we can define \textit{tax aversion} as a gut rejection of a tax (or taxation in general) that influences beliefs about the properties of a tax such as its effectiveness, fairness, or equivalence to a measure labeled differently. Our work then shows that tax aversion can be identified through motivated reasoning by observing that the initial tax rejection impacts how one integrates new information into one's beliefs." J'enlÃ¨verais tout ce qui prÃ©cÃ¨de Ã  partir de "In particular" (i.e. Little, etc.) -> ok pourquoi pas, mÃªme si l'ensemble sera peut-Ãªtre encore un peu trop long. => done.

% old: Beyond the case of carbon pricing, our paper contributes to the literature on the formation of political beliefs. Recent research has shown how beliefs on inequality and social mobility affect people's attitudes regarding distributive policies \citep[e.g.,][]{cruces_et_al_2013,kuziemko_et_al_2015,alesina_intergenerational_2018}. Our paper expands this literature by investigating the relationship between beliefs and attitudes on climate policies. It also goes further than previous studies by identifying a bidirectional relationship, as we show that not only do beliefs determine attitudes, but attitudes over policies in turn shape beliefs. Indeed, using a representative survey, our paper provides evidence consistent with theories of motivated reasoning (\citet{ziva_kunda_case_1990}; see \citet{benabou_mindful_2016} for a recent review) that have thus far been mostly tested in the lab \citep[e.g.,][]{redlawsk_hot_2002,thaler_2019}. In particular, our results support the recent theory of \citet{little_distortion_2019}, who formalizes motivated reasoning as a way to reconcile an auxiliary belief (one's self-interest in the reform) to a core belief (here, policy rejection). We believe that our results apply beyond the case of carbon taxation and illustrate more generally the determinants and consequences of tax aversion. Indeed, the few previous definitions of tax aversion \citep{sussman_axe_2011} are hardly exploitable empirically, as they do not relate the concept to an observable phenomenon. This may contribute to the limited number of papers on this topic \citep{kallbekken_et_al_2011,kessler_tax_2016}.

Beyond the case of carbon pricing, our paper contributes to the literature on the formation of political beliefs. Recent research has shown how beliefs on inequality and social mobility affect people's attitudes regarding distributive policies \citep[e.g.,][]{cruces_et_al_2013,kuziemko_et_al_2015,alesina_intergenerational_2018}.

In our context, motivated reasoning could be a manifestation of \textit{tax aversion}, which we can define as a ``gut'' rejection of a tax (or taxation in general) that influences beliefs about the properties of a tax such as its effectiveness, fairness, or equivalence to a measure labeled differently. This would explain how popular protests against the carbon tax affected people's beliefs on related policies like the tax \& dividend studied in this paper.

%%% TO AJE : "which we can define as the rejection of a tax" : we previously ad "a gut rejection", so the meaning has changed. If our formulation was incorrect, is there a way to improve it without changing the meaning?

%EDITOR: The use of "gut" may have sounded informal, but it is not incorrect. I have restored it but placed it in quotes.

% dr2 : le passage sur Tax aversion me semble un peu faible, on ne comprend pas bien ce que notre papier montre ou ne montre pas. => nouveau paragraphe ? -> Je pense qu'il faut aussi reformuler. je suis d'ailleurs plutÃ´t d'avis de garder un unique paragraphe, mais que ce soit plus clair ce que notre papier montre et ce qu'il ne montre pas. Une possibilitÃ© serait de basculer Ã§a dans le paragrahe MR en 4.1.2. => moi je trouve Ã§a bien de mentionner tax aversion dans l'intro vu que c'est dans le titre. C'est vrai que c'est absent du reste du papier, ce qui est pas top, mais du coup je trouve Ã§a bien de l'avoir visible, dans l'intro. On peut en reparler dans le paragraphe MR mais pas sÃ»r que ce soit nÃ©cessaire -> oui la difficultÃ© c'est de pas trop mettre en avant un truc qu'on ne fait pas vraiment dans le papier. Je propose de remplacer ce qu'on a par quelque chose comme "In our context, motivated reasoning could be a manifestation of \textit{tax aversion} which we can defined as (...). This would explain how the protests against the carbon tax later affected people's beliefs that causally impact their support of alternative policy proposals." en moins long et moins hypothÃ©tique si possible. => "In our context, motivated reasoning could be a manifestation of \textit{tax aversion} which we can define as (...). This would explain how popular protests against the carbon tax affected people's beliefs on related policies like the tax \& dividend." OU "... against the carbon tax (without dividend) affected people's views on the tax \& dividend proposal." -> j'aime bien la premiÃ¨re, avec peut-Ãªtre Ã  la fin "studied in this paper". Dans l'ensemble, Ã§a rÃ©pond bien au problÃ¨me non ? => oui. Tu parles bien de la 1ere que je propose ? -> oui, done. Old: Building upon our results, we can define \textit{tax aversion} as a gut rejection of a tax (or taxation in general) that influences beliefs about the properties of a tax such as its effectiveness, fairness, or equivalence to a measure labeled differently. Tax aversion can then be identified through motivated reasoning by observing that the initial tax rejection impacts how one integrates new information into one's beliefs.


The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section \ref{sec:survey}, we describe our survey and other data sources. In Section \ref{sec:perceptions}, we compare subjective perceptions to objective data and measure the bias regarding the impacts of carbon taxation. In Section \ref{sec:persistence}, we study the formation of beliefs and propose several mechanisms to rationalize people's pessimism. In Section \ref{sec:motives5}, we estimate the effects of changing people's beliefs about tax incidence and effectiveness on acceptance. Section \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes. Further results and methodological complements are reported in the Appendix and in an online Appendix. %

\section{Context, survey, and data} \label{sec:survey}

\subsection{Context of the study \label{subsec:context}}

% dr2 : "a set of measures including the abandonment of the carbon tax increases initially scheduled as well as boosts to low wages and modest pensions" -> "a set of measures including boosts to low wages and modest pensions as well as the abandonment of the carbon tax increases initially scheduled"
% dr2 : "conceded to" -> "agreed to"

% dr2 : "position towards the Yellow Vests" -> "attitude towards the Yellow Vests"

The Yellow Vests constitute a singular protest movement. Although they are overrepresented within the far left and right, they are supported by a large fraction of the French from across the political spectrum.\footnote{Table \ref{tab:profile_yellow_vests} in the online Appendix \ref{sec:profile_yellow_vests} provides data on our respondents' attitude towards the Yellow Vests depending on their sociodemographic characteristics and left-right leaning. This shows that the support for the movement is widespread. People at the center of the political spectrum are the least supportive with 46\% having a positive attitude towards the Yellow Vests vs. 66\% for the whole population.} Thousands of small-scale protests were organized autonomously on social networks, and the movement was remarkably independent from political parties and unions. Before the emergence of the movement, none of the major political parties campaigned against the carbon tax, and this policy did not trigger specific opposition until the increase in oil prices brought it to the forefront of the debate.\footnote{Fuel prices peaked in October 2018. The movement gained momentum at that time, leading to the first massive protest on November 17.} The opposition then quickly gained ground, notably through Facebook, where a petition against the tax and a call to protest on roundabouts were widely spread. These protests initially occurred every day and did not start decreasing until December 2018, when the government responded with a set of measures including supplements to low wages and modest pensions and the abandonment of the carbon tax increases initially scheduled. The fading movement came to an almost complete halt at the end of April 2019 when the government agreed to some of the demands for greater purchasing power and direct democracy \citep{boyer_les_2020}.


%%% TO AJE : "increasing low wages" : we previously had "boosts to low wages" because this policy is a transfer that comes on top of the wage, but it is not an increase in the wage itself. Can we revert to "boosts to low wages" or an alternative expression that would preserve the meaning?

%EDITOR: I have revised this to "supplements to low wages"

% sss: is it clear that "greater" (instead of "more") also applies to "direct democracy"? %% RCP NOTE: Yes, I believe it is clear that "greater" applies to both "purchasing power" and "direct democracy."

% sss doesn't "is" (that French people...) instead of "could be" imply that we endorse this interpretation? We do not, hence "could be" seems better to us. %% RCP NOTE: Edited.
A simple interpretation of these protests could be that French people are far more concerned with their purchasing power than climate change. However, our companion paper documents that a large majority of French people are aware of and concerned about climate change and supportive of various climate policies, such as a tax on air travel, green investments or stricter pollution norms, \citep{douenne_french_2019},\footnote{The levels of awareness and concern are similar to those of other countries \citep{stokes_global_2015}. For instance, 72\% know that climate change is anthropogenic compared to 66\% in the US \href{https://news.gallup.com/poll/1615/environment.aspx}{(Gallup, 2019)}.} and our survey suggests that French people’s willingness-to-pay for a carbon tax is similar to that of other countries (see online Appendix \ref{sec:WTP}). Instead, French people may simply not regard a carbon tax as the appropriate policy to address climate change. Thus, the present paper sheds light on people's beliefs about the carbon tax, how these beliefs form and how they affect policy support. %

%%% TO AJE : "how they form their beliefs" : "their beliefs" has been added, but it changes the meaning. It is beliefs that affect policy support, and not people. Can we simply revert to the previous formulation or should we still change something to clarify?

%EDITOR: I have revised this to "how these beliefs form and how they affect policy support", which more clearly conveys your meaning.

\subsection{Our survey\label{subsec:Survey-Beliefs-climate}}

\subsubsection{Survey data collection }

%dr2 (voix passive) : "The survey was conducted in February" -> "We conduced the survey in February"
%dr2 (voix passive) : "Respondents are paid" -> "Respondents receive"
%dr2 (voix passive) : "The quotas are relaxed " -> "We relaxed the quotas"
% sr2 (voix passive) : "observations are weighted" -> "we weighted observations" ? => je dirais non -> tu trouves que Ã§a sonne bizarre ? => oui je trouve que Ã§a fait bizarre de prendre un rÃ´le actif pour un truc qui est indispensable/Ã©vident
% sr2 : "The 3,002 responses were collected through" -> "We collected 3,002 responses through" => je laisserais aussi

We conduced the survey in February and March 2019, three months after the government decided to abandon the planned increase in the carbon tax. The 3,002 responses were collected through the survey company Bilendi. This company maintains a panel of French respondents whom they can email with survey links. The respondents received 3\euro{} if they fully completed the survey. The respondents who choose to respond are first channeled through screening questions that ensure that the final sample is representative in terms of six sociodemographic characteristics: gender, age (5 brackets), education (4), socioprofessional category (8), town size (5) and region (9). We relaxed the quotas by 5\% to 10\% relative to the actual proportions to facilitate the sampling process. Table \ref{tab:Sample-Characteristics} in the Appendix \ref{sec:Raw-Data} shows that our sample is still extremely representative. Nonetheless, observations are weighted to correct for small differences between the sample and population frequencies (e.g., in education). The median time to complete the survey was 19 minutes. We ensured that all questions requiring some concentration were in the first half of the survey. We took several steps to ensure the best possible data quality. Our representative sample was obtained after excluding the inattentive and quickest respondents. We confirm in the online Appendix \ref{app:speed} that this sampling restriction does not affect the main results. %

% dr2: l'Ã©diteur prÃ©fÃ¨re "Information intervention" que "Priming" mais il nous laisse dÃ©cider. Les deux me vont, je suis d'accord qu'Information intervention est plus parlant (et "priming" peut parfois Ãªtre simplement remplacÃ© par "information" dans le reste du papier) donc j'ai aussi une petite prÃ©fÃ©rence pour cette option, mais garder ce qu'on a me convient aussi. => ok, j'ai pas de prÃ©fÃ©rence partticuliÃ¨re ici, on peut changer du coup -> ok mais changer lÃ  Ã§a demande de changer partout dans le texte je suppose, qu'est-ce que tu en penses ? => oui, le plus chiant c'est de changer dans la figure. Si l'Ã©diteur nous laisse le choix, on peut garder "priming" par flemme. Mais c'est ptet mieux de suivre sa prÃ©fÃ©rence quand mÃªme, surtout qu'on est indiffÃ©rent. -> ok je change partout en notifiant (selon que je met information ou informational treatment ou information intervention).


%dr2 : "Priming" -> "Information intervention"
\paragraph{Information intervention on environmental issues}

%dr2 : "This priming divides" -> "This informational treatment divides"
%dr2 : "objective of these primings" -> "objective of these treatments"
% dr2 (voix passive) : "Two blocks of information are then randomly displayed:" -> "We then randomly display two blocs of information:"
% dr2 (voix passive) : "The time spent on each block is saved, and links to scientific references are displayed to support the information." -> "We save the time spent on each block, and we display links to scientific references to support the information." done en enlevant le second "we"

The survey opens with a brief presentation: three short sentences to welcome the participant, introduce ourselves as ``two social science researchers'', and explain that the survey will last 15 to 20 minutes. We then randomly display two blocks of information: one on climate change and another on particulate matter (i.e., air pollution). This informational treatment divides the sample into four groups who receive either one block of information, the other block of information, no block of information, or both blocks of information. The objective of these treatments is to see whether providing salient information on the consequences of climate change or air pollution affects respondents' answers later in the survey. The climate change information includes temperature trends for the long-run future, concerning facts on current and expected impacts, and a claim that keeping global warming below 2\,℃ is technically feasible. The particulate information consists of the estimated impact on French mortality (48,000 deaths per year) and life expectancy (reduced by 9 months on average in France) and the assertion that reducing fuel consumption would improve health. We save the time spent on each block and display links to scientific references to support the information.

% sss "in line" loses part of the meaning of "much in line" no? We prefer to put back "much", but if that sounds weird, "in line" might be sufficient. %% RCP NOTE: I think "in line with" is sufficient. -> Ã§a fait effectivement peut-Ãªtre un peu lourd le "much", Ã§a me va de laisser comme Ã§a
\paragraph{Household characteristics}
In addition to the six quota strata, the sociodemographic characteristics include zip code, household structure, and the income of the respondent and of the household. A block on energy characteristics contains questions that allow us to estimate the impact of a carbon tax increase on housing expenditures (energy source and home size) and on transport expenditures (number of vehicles, type(s) of fuel, distance traveled last year, and average fuel economy). The distributions of the answers are in line with official statistics, as shown in Table \ref{tab:app-energetic-characs} in the Appendix \ref{sec:Raw-Data}.

\paragraph{Sectoral tax \& dividend} %

% dr2 : "these energies" -> "these sources of energy"
%dr2 : l'Ã©diteur signal un problÃ¨me avec "price elasticities (see 2.3.1)." mais je ne vois pas lequel, le commentaire n'apparait pas. => je vois pas non plus quel est le pb... ptet rajouter Section? -> oui surement, faisons Ã§a.
% dr2 (voix passive) : "They are presented with a specific policy:" -> "We present them a specific policy".

We first randomly allocate the respondent to one of the two sectors to which the French carbon tax applies: housing \textit{or} transport. We present a specific policy to them: a sectoral tax \& dividend, i.e., an increase in housing \textit{or} transport energy taxes that would finance a lump-sum transfer to all adults.\footnote{We chose to redistribute the money per adult instead of per consumption unit to make the scheme more understandable. We limited the number of beneficiaries to two per household to better align this policy with current welfare benefits that depend on the number of consumption units.} We detail the price increases that would follow and the value of the dividend they would receive: for the housing energy tax, $+13\%$ for gas and $+15\%$ for heating oil together with a yearly transfer of 50\euros{} per adult; and for the transport energy tax, $+0.11$\euro{} per liter of gasoline and $+0.13$\euro{}/L for diesel with a yearly transfer of 60\euro{} per adult. These figures are equivalent to an increase in the carbon price on these sources of energy by 50\euros{}/t$\text{CO}_{2}$, but we do not mention the name ``carbon tax'' at this stage since we do not want people to think that it also falls on the other sector. The value of the dividends was obtained such that the policy is budget neutral and assuming typical price elasticities (see Section \ref{subsubsec:comparing-obj-subj}). We present the policy starting with ``The government studies...'' to capture the effect of distrust in the government that could arise in the actual political process.

% dr2 win/lose category thereafter => \textit{win/lose category} thereafter
Then, we ask the respondent whether their household would win, lose, or be unaffected by the reform in terms of purchasing power (\textit{win/lose category} thereafter). Depending on their answer, we further ask respondents to estimate their expected gain (or loss) among 5 (or 6) intervals. The interval thresholds are tailored to each respondent since they are computed in proportion to the number of consumption units (c.u.) of the household (as defined by \href{http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:Equivalised_disposable_income}{Eurostat}).\footnote{For instance, for a single-member household (c.u.=1), the intervals of the expected gain (in \euro{}/year) are $\left(0,\,10\right)$, $\left(10,\,20\right)$, etc.; and for a childless couple (c.u.=1.5), these intervals are $\left(0,15\,\right)$, $\left(15,\,30\right)$, etc.} Similarly, households' gains and losses are always expressed per consumption unit in the analysis. In an effort to obtain accurate answers, we did not provide monetary rewards for responses to the questions. Indeed, \citet{sapienza_zingales_2013} show that people think that economic experts are too optimistic regarding the carbon tax, and so incentivizing the answers could have led respondents to misreport their true beliefs and shift them towards what they think the researchers expect. Finally, to see whether people think that the tax achieves its purpose of incentivizing people, we ask respondents to estimate their own elasticity and that of French people in general. To this end, we borrow the phrasing of \citet{baranzini_effectiveness_2017} and ask for the expected decrease in consumption (in 5 brackets) that would follow a 30\% increase in the price of heating (or equivalently, an increase of 0.50\euro{}/L in fuel prices).

%%% TO AJE : we think "the purpose of the incentive of the tax is operative" does not preserve the intended meaning. "the incentive purpose" should be better to convey the idea that the tax aims at incentivizing people. Can you confirm?

%EDITOR: I have revised this to "whether people think that the tax achieves its purpose of incentivizing people".

%%% TO AJE : can be replace "We did not incentivize the questions by using monetary rewards to obtain accurate answers." by "To obtain accurate answers, we did not incentivize the questions by using monetary rewards." to make it less ambiguous?

%EDITOR: I believe that "In an effort to obtain accurate answers, we did not provide monetary rewards for responses to the questions" conveys your intended meaning well.

% sr2 (voix passive) : "The interval thresholds are tailored to each respondent" -> "We tailored interval thresholds to each respondent". => nope -> c'est vrai que celui-lÃ  sonne pas trÃ¨s bien
% dr2 (voix passive) : "The questions were not incentivized by monetary" -> "We did not incentiviez the questions by monetary"
% dr2 (voix passive) : "respondents are asked to estimate" -> "we ask respondents to estimate"

%dr2 : "ask for the expected decrease in consumption that would follow a 30\% increase in the price of heating (or equivalently, an increase of 0.50\euro{}/L in fuel prices) among 5 brackets." -> "ask for the expected decrease in consumption (in 5 brackets) that would follow a 30\% increase in the price of heating (or equivalently, an increase of 0.50\euro{}/L in fuel prices)."

% dr2 : je suggÃ¨re de clarifier ce passage en rÃ©organisant de la maniÃ¨re suivante : "We now explicitly present the reform as an increase in the carbon tax, although as before we do not give the implicit carbon price but rather the effect on energy prices (the same as before but on both sectors) and the value of the dividend.\footnote{For the exact phrasing, see question \ref{questionnaire:TD} in online Appendix \ref{sec:questionnaire}.} A new informational treatment stating that ``scientists agree that a carbon tax would be effective in reducing pollution'' is randomly displayed, splitting the sample in two. After describing the reform and providing (or not) this priming, a first block of questions elicits the respondent's perceptions. Their subjective net gain in purchasing power is asked about in the same manner as for the sectoral tax, with adapted intervals. We then ask them whether the reform would be effective in reducing pollution and combating climate change. Finally, we ask..." => c'est vrai que c'est plus clair, mais embÃªtant de perdre le 110â‚¬. Aussi, c'est inexact de dire que le priming arrive avant toutes les questions perceptions, mais bon pk pas vu que Ã§a clarifie. -> je comptais pas enlever le 110, j'ai juste pas repris les deux premiÃ¨res phrases que je comptais garder, je voulais simplement indiquer le changement Ã  partir de "We now explicitly..." => ah oui d'accord. Ok le changement me va, done. Was: We now explicitly present the reform as an increase in the carbon tax, although as before we do not give the implicit carbon price but rather the effect on energy prices (the same as before but on both sectors) and the value of the dividend.\footnote{For the exact phrasing, see question \ref{questionnaire:TD} in online Appendix \ref{sec:questionnaire}.} After describing the reform, a first block of questions elicits the respondent's perceptions. Their subjective net gain in purchasing power is asked about in the same manner as for the sectoral tax, with adapted intervals. The priming that ``scientists agree that a carbon tax would be effective in reducing pollution'' is randomly displayed before asking whether the reform would be effective in reducing pollution and combating climate change.

Our main reform of interest is an increase of 50\euros{}/t$\text{CO}_{2}$ in the French carbon tax, which concerns \textit{both} housing and transport.\footnote{Electricity and industries are exempt from the French carbon tax because they are already covered by the EU-ETS.} The revenues generated are again redistributed equally so that each adult receives a yearly lump-sum compensation of 110\euros{}. We now explicitly present the reform as an increase in the carbon tax, although, as before, we do not give the implicit carbon price but rather the effect on energy prices (the same as before but on both sectors) and the value of the dividend.\footnote{For the exact phrasing, see question \ref{questionnaire:TD} in the online Appendix \ref{sec:questionnaire}.} We randomly display a new informational treatment stating that ``scientists agree that a carbon tax would be effective in reducing pollution'', thereby splitting the sample in two. After describing the reform and providing (or not providing) this information, a first block of questions elicits the respondent's perceptions. We ask about their win/lose category and their subjective net gain in purchasing power in the same manner as for the sectoral tax with adapted intervals. We then ask them whether the reform would be effective in reducing pollution and combating climate change. Finally, we ask, ``Would you approve of this reform?'' and let the respondent choose between ``Yes'', ``No'' and ``PNR (I don't know, I don't want to answer)''.\footnote{In English, ``PNR'' stands for ``Prefer Not to Respond''.} In the following, we say that respondents \emph{approve} of a reform if they respond ``Yes'' and \emph{accept} the reform if they do \emph{not} respond ``No''. Table \ref{tab:approval_td} in the online Appendix \ref{app:des_stat_approval} describes the rates of support for the tax \& dividend policies at different stages of the survey.

Je pense que l'Ã©diteur prÃ©fÃ©rera. => ok bonne idÃ©e  : diagramme modifiÃ© pour prÃ©senter la question progressivitÃ© dans un bloc sÃ©parÃ©.

Si tu prÃ©fÃ¨res on met "latter half" dans la note du diagramme aussi -> mais "latter" Ã§a ne correspond Ã  rien ici, il nous demande d'ailleurs "which latter half?". => tu proposes quoi ? -> je ne sais pas quoi faire... On peut expliquer que c'est bien la deuxiÃ¨me moitiÃ© du sample Ã  qui on a posÃ© la quetsion, mais on ouvre un peu la boite de Pandore parce que s'il s'aperÃ§oit qu'il y a aussi un problÃ¨me avec info_EE Ã§a va pas aller du tout. Une solution sinon c'est d'Ã©crire seulement "To half of the sample" mais c'est un peu mentir. Au pire s'il pose des questions on dit qu'il y avait un petit souci dans le code du questionnaire donc les deux randomisations (info_ee et question progressivitÃ©) qui Ã©taient liÃ©es ont pas Ã©tÃ© donnÃ©es Ã  la moitiÃ© des gens. Qu'est-ce que tu en penses toi ? => y a pas de raison qu'il capte pour info_ee.

LÃ  on en a tenu compte en modifiant le diagramme. -> pour moi si on Ã©lude c'est en supprimant "later" parce que mettre "latter" sans expliquer quel "latter" c'est pas satisfaisant => c'est une question d'anglais: si "later" s'Ã©crit en fait "latter", alors c'est bon (?), sinon effectivement, faudra y re-rÃ©flÃ©chir (et ptet dire "To half of the sample" dans ce cas). -> oui c'est ce que je propose, Ã§a permet s'il pose des questions de ne pas dire que c'est seulement ceux de la fin, mais un bug qui fait qu'on n'a pas la moitiÃ© (donc Ã§a n'implique pas forcÃ©ment que c'est pas alÃ©atoire). => tu proposes de mettre "To half of the sample" directement ? C'est ce que tu proposes aussi non ? => non moi je propose de le faire que si un natif nous dit que "later half" et "latter half" ont des sens diffÃ©rents. -> il faudra qu'on en rediscute mais on peut ne voir Ã§a qu'Ã  la toute fin, il n' s'agit que d'un mot Ã  garder ou enlever. => un natif m'a dit que "later" et "latter" Ã©taient parfaitement synonymes, qu'on utiliserait plutÃ´t "latter" ici, mais que c'est pas clair que Ã§a rÃ©fÃ¨re Ã  la chronologie. Je proposerais de laisser comme Ã§a quand mÃªme pck en enlevant "latter" notre phrase perd son sens; en fait on explique de faÃ§on un peu obscure Ã  cet endroit qu'on a changÃ© le sondage en cours de route, donc je trouve Ã§a bien. -> oui mais il nous pose la question "which latter?" Ã  laquelle on ne rÃ©pond pas, tu paris sur le fait qu'il reviendra pas dessus ? => oui. Toi tu proposes de dire "to half of the sample" c'est Ã§a ? Ã§a rÃ©pond pas plus Ã  sa question. -> le mieux ets d'en parler Ã  voix haute prochainement parce que c'est un truc important -> du coup on change en "latter half" ? => done
%dr2 : "the previous priming" -> "the previous informational treatment"
% dr2 : changer le texte prÃ©sentant la randomisation des traitements. => proposition: To a random half of the sample, we provide customized information explaining the following: ``In five cases out of six, a household with your characteristics would {[}win/lose{]} through the reform.

To assess how people form their beliefs and measure the importance of self-interest and fairness motives in the acceptance of the reform, we then provide some information on the effect of the reform. To half of the sample selected at random, we provide customized information explaining the following: ``In five cases out of six, a household with your characteristics would {[}win/lose{]} through the reform.

To two-thirds of the respondents (the remaining half plus one-third of the respondents with the previous informational treatment on \emph{progressivity}), we provide customized information explaining the following: ``In five cases out of six, a household with your characteristics would {[}win/lose{]} through the reform.

Then, we again ask about the win/lose category (i.e., if the respondent's household would win, lose or be unaffected by the reform) and for the approval of the reform. We also ask respondents about the perceived advantages and disadvantages of the policy, including the effect on the poorest households. For the second half of the sample, immediately after the treatment on progressivity, we explicitly ask whether they think that the reform would benefit the poorest since most respondents appeared not to believe our information. %

% dr2 the \emph{ERFS} => official data
% dr2 (voix passive) : "Respondents whose income lies between two thresholds are allocated randomly to..." -> "We randomly allocate respondents whose income lies between two thresholds to..."
To disentangle the effect of self-interest from other motives for acceptance in Section \ref{sec:motives5}, we then propose to respondents an alternative reform where only some people are eligible for the dividend. Specifically, we propose one of four alternative reforms where the payments, which are still equal among recipients, are targeted to adults whose income is below some threshold. The four possible thresholds correspond to the 20th, 30th, 40th, and 50th percentiles of the income distribution. They are computed using inflated deciles of individual income from the \emph{Enquête sur les Revenus Socio-Fiscaux} (ERFS 2014) produced by Insee (the French national statistics bureau).\footnote{Income sources that are entitlements for the household rather than its members, such as certain welfare benefits, are divided equally among the two oldest adults in the household.} We randomly allocate respondents whose income lies between two thresholds to the reform defined by one of these thresholds. For example, a person at the 25th percentile of the income distribution has a one-in-two chance to face the reform targeted to the bottom 30\%, where they are eligible for the dividend; and a one-in-two chance to face the reform targeted to the bottom 20\%, where they are not. When the income is close to only one threshold (i.e., when its percentile in the distribution is below 20 or within $\left[50;70\right]$), the allocated reform corresponds to that one. When the respondent's income is distant from all thresholds, i.e., when it is in the \textit{top} 30\% (above 2220\euros{}/month), the reform they face is determined by the income of the household's second adult. Finally, when both adults (or the only adult) in the household are in the top 30\%, their reform is allocated randomly from the four variants. Table \ref{tab:Compensation-amount-by} details the income thresholds and dividends of the four variants and the proportion of respondents allocated to each of them, along with the proportion one would expect from the official data. The two sets of figures match almost perfectly, indicating that our sample is representative according to income.

We describe to each respondent the variant they face: the price increases, the income threshold and the value of the dividend. We also specify how many persons in their household would be eligible for the payment. Finally, we ask respondents again for their anticipated win/lose category and their approval. The random variation in eligibility creates exogenous variation in the win/lose belief, which we use to estimate its causal effect on acceptance in a fuzzy RDD.



\paragraph{Other questions}

We do not detail the other questions of the survey because we devote a companion paper to their analysis, \citet{douenne_french_2019}. In these questions, we examine the opinions on environmental policies, including other ways to use the revenues from a carbon tax. We measure the knowledge and perceptions of climate change and ask specific questions on the influence of climate change on the choice to give birth and one's willingness to change one's lifestyle. We study the use, availability of, and satisfaction with public transportation and active mobility. We also ask questions regarding political preferences, including attitude toward the Yellow Vests. Finally, we let the respondent express any comments in a text box.

\subsection{Official household surveys\label{subsec:Households-surveys}}

% dr2 added "the value of" the dividend
In addition to our survey, we use three official household surveys produced by Insee\footnote{The additional datasets are the consumer survey \emph{Budget de Famille} (BdF 2011), the transport survey \emph{Enquête Nationale Transports et Déplacements} (ENTD 2008) and the housing survey \emph{Enquête Logement} (EL 2013). We use data from National Accounts to homogeneously inflate households’ sectoral expenditures from each dataset we use to make them representative of the most recent trend and comparable across datasets. For more information about these surveys, see the Appendix \ref{appendix:official_surveys_insee}.} for two purposes. First, we use the consumer and the transport surveys to compute the objective distribution of the increases in fuel expenditures and the revenue from the tax (and hence the value of the dividend). Second, we use the housing survey to compute a respondent-specific estimate of their objective net gain.

Second, we use the housing survey to compute a respondent-specific estimate of the objective net gain. It allows us to measure respondents' bias regarding their net gain and provide them with customized win/lose feedback. The precision of this estimate is assessed by testing it out-of-sample on the consumer survey. The different steps are explained below.\footnote{Data from National Accounts are used to homogeneously inflate householdsâ€™ sectoral expenditures from each dataset we use to make them representative of the most recent trend and comparable across datasets.}"

\subsubsection{Eliciting objective aggregates and distributions \label{subsubsec:comparing-obj-subj}}

%dr2 : merge \paragraph{Data} and \paragraph{Computing tax incidence and revenues} and shorten the section.

J'aime autant la garder mais si tu penses qu'il faut rÃ©duire cette section pourquoi pas la bouger. => nan Ã§a me va de garder, c'Ã©tait une suggestion avec assez peu de conviction
We use the database constructed by \citet{douenne_2020} that matches the consumer and transport surveys. It includes over 10,000 households for whom it provides information on all their revenues and expenditures---including their energy bills---together with many sociodemographic characteristics. From this combined dataset, we are able to determine the increase in expenditures that households would face following changes in tax rates and compute the total tax revenue to be redistributed in a lump-sum (see the Appendix \ref{appendix:formulas} for more details). We thereby obtain the distribution of households' \textit{objective} net gains in purchasing power implied by the policies proposed. Formally, the net gain $\gamma_h$ of household $h$ (the notations are explained in the Appendix \ref{sec:notations}) can be expressed as follows:

\vspace{-0.4cm} % nÃ©cessaire pour faire passer le titre de la sous-section suivante sur cette page

where $D$ denotes the value of the dividend, $N^a_h$ is the number of adults receiving it in this household, and $\Delta E$ is the increases in their energy expenditures.

% old : For the first purpose, we use the database constructed by \citet{douenne_2020}, whose objective was to estimate the distributional effects of a carbon tax on French households. It builds on the consumer survey (BdF 2011) that includes over 10,000 households for whom it provides information on all their revenues and expenditures---including their energy bills---together with many socio-demographic characteristics. This survey is matched to the transport survey (ENTD 2008) to correct for short-run fluctuations in transport fuel consumption. Such matching is not necessary for housing energy, which already represents consumption over long periods in BdF.\footnote{For more information about these surveys, see Appendix \ref{appendix:official_surveys_insee}.}

\paragraph{Simulating expected net gains}
% dr2 his or her => their (twice)
To measure each respondent's bias and to provide customized feedback on their win/lose category, we estimate their net gain by using equation (\ref{eq:formula_net_gain}). We directly compute the increase in transport fuel expenditures $\Delta E^{transport}$ from the information reported on their yearly distance traveled and the average fuel consumption of their vehicles. From the housing survey---which provides information on households' housing energy bills---we compute $\Delta E^{housing}$ and regress it on household characteristics. We then use the coefficients obtained to compute $\widehat{\Delta E}^{housing}$ for the households of our own survey respondents. The specification we chose is presented in the Appendix \ref{appendix:estimation_feedback_regression} and compared with alternative specifications and prediction methods.

% sr2 (voix passive) : "The specification we chose is presented in Appendix C.3 and compared with alternative specifications and prediction methods" -> "We present the specification we chose in Appendix C.3 and compare it with alternative specifications and prediction methods" => boarf ici je laisserais

% sr2: move following sentence to Appendix: We make this ratio symmetrical to balance the shares of overly optimistic and overly pessimistic feedback: among households in BdF predicted to win, 83.4\% were actual winners, while among those predicted to lose, 83.4\% were actual losers (see Figure \ref{fig:proba_pred} in Appendix \ref{subsec:app_perception_si}). And maybe also the next sentence (the editor said 1.5 page, we are at 2 p) -> tout Ã§a me paraÃ®t indispensable pour le lecteur, j'aimerais autant le mettre en footnote Ã  la limite, mais Ã§a fait une trÃ¨s grosse footnote. => ok, on garde
% dr2 (voix passive) : "Because the prediction was made from a different survey than the one on which it was tested," -> "Because we made the prediction from a different survey than the one on which we tested it".
To assess the accuracy of our prediction, we test it out-of-sample on the consumer survey. Indeed, for households in this survey, we both obtain the true net gain $\gamma$ and use our prediction to estimate $\widehat{\gamma}$ and then assess the likelihood of correctly predicting their win/lose category. Because we made the prediction by using a different survey than the one on which we tested it, we avoided the risk of overfitting. For five households out of six, we correctly predict whether their purchasing power would increase or decrease due to the policy. We make this ratio symmetrical to balance the shares of overly optimistic and overly pessimistic feedback. Among the households in BdF predicted to win, 83.4\% were actual winners, while among those predicted to lose, 83.4\% were actual losers (see Figure \ref{fig:proba_pred} in the Appendix \ref{subsec:app_perception_si}). Assuming that the characteristics reported by our respondents are correct, there is no reason to believe that the probability of error is higher or lower when simulations are applied to our survey respondents.\footnote{In particular, a critical assumption is that people correctly reported their distance traveled and the average fuel economy of their vehicles so that the computation of $\Delta E^{transport}$ is correct. As shown in Table \ref{tab:Sample-Characteristics} in the Appendix \ref{sec:Raw-Data}, the values reported by respondents follow a distribution very similar to that found in the official statistics.}


% old : \subsubsection{Computing households' expected net gains\label{subsubsec:computation_feedback}}

% \paragraph{Simulating expected net gains}
% To measure each respondent's bias and to provide customized feedback on his or her win/lose category, we need to estimate his or her net gain as expressed by equation (\ref{eq:formula_net_gain}). Since households are asked about the yearly distance travelled and average fuel consumption of their private vehicles, we can directly compute the increase in transport fuel expenditures $\Delta E^{transport}$. However, we lack housing energy expenses to evaluate $\Delta E^{housing}$. We therefore need to estimate it based on household energy characteristics. To do so, we use the housing survey \emph{EnquÃªte Logement} (EL 2013), which again provides information on household expenditures on housing energy and many demographic and energy characteristics. It enables us to compute $\Delta E^{housing}$ and regress it on household characteristics. The coefficients obtained can then be used to compute $\widehat{\Delta E}^{housing}$ (and thus obtain $\widehat{\gamma}$) for any household. The specification we chose is as follows:

% \begin{equation}
% \label{formula_reg_net_gain}
%     \Delta E^{housing}_h = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \chi^G_h + \beta_2 \chi^F_h + \beta_3 \sigma_h + \epsilon_h
% \end{equation}

% \noindent
% where $\chi^G_h$ (resp. $\chi^F_h$) is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the household uses gas (res. heating oil) for heating and $\sigma$ is the size of the household's accommodation in square meters. The results are provided in Appendix \ref{appendix:estimation_feedback_regression}, where they are shown to be as accurate as those obtained from alternative prediction methods and specifications, with the advantage of being more robust to potential misreporting of the size of the accommodation. %

% \paragraph{Assessing feedback's accuracy}

% The previous estimation could have also been conducted with BdF data. Nevertheless, running this estimation on the housing survey is very useful: it enables us to test the accuracy of our prediction out-of-sample. Indeed, since for households in BdF data, we observe both their energy characteristics and their actual energy bills, we can both directly calculate $\Delta E^{housing}$ and use our prediction to compute $\widehat{\Delta E}^{housing}$. Adding to this the additional costs arising from transport energies and the dividend, we can obtain both their true net gain $\gamma$ and their estimated net gain $\widehat{\gamma}$. This allows us to estimate the likelihood of correctly predicting the win/lose category for these households. Because the prediction was made from a different survey than the one on which it was tested, we avoided the risk of overfitting.

% Figure \ref{fig:proba_pred} in Appendix \ref{subsec:app_perception_si} shows how the probability that our prediction is correct depends on objective gains. For five households out of six, we correctly predict whether their purchasing power would increase or decrease from the policy. We make this ratio symmetrical to balance the shares of overly optimistic and overly pessimistic feedback: among households in BdF predicted to win, 83.4\% were actual winners, while among those predicted to lose, 83.4\% were actual losers. Assuming that the characteristics reported by our respondents are correct, there is no reason to believe that the probability of error is higher or lower when simulations are applied to our survey respondents.\footnote{In particular, a critical assumption is that people correctly reported their distance travelled and the average fuel economy of their vehicles, so that the computation of $\Delta E^{transport}$ is correct. As shown in Table \ref{tab:Sample-Characteristics} in Appendix \ref{sec:Raw-Data}, the values reported by respondents follow a distribution very similar to that found in official statistics.}

\subsection{Self-interest}\label{subsec:perc_si}

\paragraph{Overestimation of policy costs}

% sr2 : Dans la lettre Ã  l'Ã©diteur, dire qu'on a bien clarifier le lien avec les questions du sondage dans cette section. edit!


% dr2 : prÃ©ciser de quelle question on parle (Ã§a me semble pourtant clair). Clarifier un peu le propos dans ce paragraphe en rÃ©ponse Ã  ses remarques. L'Ã©diteur souhaite qu'on prÃ©cise d'abord les questions Ã©tudiÃ©es avant de donner les rÃ©sultats. Je propose de reprendre le paragraphe comme suit : "..." => ok trÃ¨s bien, j'ai rempalcÃ©. Was: While 70\% of households should benefit (in monetary terms) from the compensated carbon tax, only 14\% think that they would (and 22\% see themselves as unaffected).\footnote{For transport and housing energy taxes, the objective proportions of winners are very similar at 74\% and 67\%, respectively, while the subjective shares are 16\% and 17\% (with 22\% and 30\% unaffected).} Figure \ref{fig:step_cdf} compares the CDF of expected net gains for objective data from Insee and subjective beliefs from our survey.\footnote{The subjective intervals are translated into numerical values, assuming that the distribution within each interval is the same as that in the Insee data. Within each bin, we draw values that match the actual distribution for the PDF, while we simply take the actual average for the CDF. Among the several methods that we considered to assign numerical values, all realistic ones yield identical results, and we find an overestimation of policy costs even in the most conservative approach (taking the maximal bounds of intervals).} It is evident from these figures that on average, respondents overestimate the cost of the policy, even in the extreme case of perfectly inelastic expenditures. This result holds both for the carbon tax and partial carbon taxes on transport and housing energy. The average net gains from the carbon tax on transport, housing, and both are 18\euro{} per consumption unit (c.u. ), 6\euro{} per c.u., and 24\euro{} per c.u., respectively. from BdF data. Extrapolating from our survey, we instead find average subjective net gains of $-61$\euro{}, $-43$\euro{}, and $-89$\euro{}. The median gap of 116\euro{} between objective and subjective gains indicates a substantial bias towards loss from typical respondents. This bias is widespread, as we find that 89\% of respondents underestimate their gain in purchasing power relative to our household-specific estimation. (The full distribution of respondents' bias is provided in Figure \ref{fig:bias} in Appendix \ref{appendix:estimation_feedback_regression}.) This proportion remains as high as 77\% when assuming inelastic expenditures, which provides a lower bound on the share who underestimate their net gain in utility.

Peut-Ãªtre la derniÃ¨re version du coup => la moins lourde c'est celle avec "for" je dirais, mais pas sÃ»r que ce soit correct comme formulation -> ok en remplaÃ§ant "for" par "using" ? => dans ce cas plutÃ´t "net gains estimated using objective data from Insee" que "expected net gains using objective data from Insee" non?

% dr2 : "This result holds both for the carbon tax and partial carbon taxes on transport and housing energy." -> "This result holds both for sectoral carbon taxes on transport and housing energy and the carbon tax \& dividend policy." pour que les intitulÃ©s correspondent et soient dans le mÃªme ordre que ceux du diagramme.

The analysis of respondents' beliefs about the impact of both sectoral taxes and the carbon tax \& dividend policy shows a clear overestimation of the incidence of these taxes on their household. Figure \ref{fig:step_cdf} compares the CDF of the objective net gains estimated using official data with the subjective beliefs from our survey for both sectoral taxes and the tax \& dividend policy. It is evident from these figures that on average, respondents overestimate the cost of these policies, even in the extreme case of perfectly inelastic expenditures. This result holds both for sectoral carbon taxes on transport and housing energy and the carbon tax \& dividend policy. The average objective net gains from the taxes on transport, housing, and both (i.e. the tax \& dividend) are 18\euros{} per consumption unit (c.u.), 6\euros{} per c.u., and 24\euros{} per c.u., respectively. Extrapolating from our survey, we instead find average subjective net gains of $-61$\euros{}, $-43$\euros{}, and $-89$\euros{}, respectively.\footnote{The subjective intervals are translated into numerical values, assuming that the distribution within each interval is the same as that in the Insee data. Within each bin, we simply take the actual average for the CDF. Among the several methods that we considered to assign numerical values, all realistic ones yield identical results, and we find that the policy costs are overestimated, even in the most conservative approach (taking the maximal bounds of intervals).} For the tax \& dividend, while 70\% of households should benefit (in monetary terms) from it, only 14\% think that they would (and 22\% see themselves as unaffected).\footnote{For the transport and housing energy taxes, the objective proportions of winners are very similar at 74\% and 67\%, respectively, while the subjective shares are 16\% and 17\%, respectively (with 22\% and 30\% unaffected, respectively).} The median gap of 116\euros{} between objective and subjective gains for this policy indicates a substantial bias towards loss from typical respondents. This bias is widespread, as we find that 89\% of respondents underestimate their purchasing power gains relative to our household-specific estimation. (The full distribution of respondents' bias is provided in Figure \ref{fig:bias} in the Appendix \ref{appendix:estimation_feedback_regression}.) This proportion remains as high as 77\% when assuming inelastic expenditures, which provides a lower bound on the share who underestimate their net utility gain.

To characterize profiles of individuals more likely to misperceive their gains, we regress what we call a \textit{large bias} over many respondent characteristics. A large bias is defined as a gap between objectively estimated and subjective net gains greater than 110\euros{} per c.u. for our tax \& dividend policy.\footnote{Indeed, our estimation differs from the true objective gain by more than 110\euros{} in only 5\% of cases. This definition ensures that for the 55\% of respondents with a large bias, there is a clear gap between their subjective perceptions and their actual net gains. Other definitions yield very similar results.} The results given in Table \ref{tab:bias} show that having a large bias is largely idiosyncratic: when controlling for a large set of variables\footnote{The control variables used throughout the paper are described in the Appendix \ref{set_controls}.} (column 1), R$^\textnormal{2}$ remains small (0.06). Nevertheless, we identify several variables having a significant effect on \textit{large bias}, even when controlling the false discovery rate at 5\%.\footnote{To conduct the multiple testing procedure \citep[following][]{benjamini_controlling_1995}, instead of associating each dummy with a different null hypothesis, we used F-tests of joint nullity for the dummies of each categorical variable and for two additional triplets of variables: those related to household composition and those related to income.} While we find that environmentalists are less likely to display a large bias and that the standard left/right political leaning has no significant effect, the degree of support for the Yellow Vests movement is positively associated with a large bias. This effect increases with the degree of adhesion, up to 20 p.p. for individuals who reported being part of the movement. Column (3) additionally includes one's attitude towards the policy when it is first presented as a covariate. We see that people who approve of the policy at the initial stage are 28 p.p. less likely to have a large bias than those who do not accept it and 10 p.p. less likely than those who do not know.

%dr2 : "EDITOR'S NOTE:" ci dessous dÃ©placÃ©e pour Ã©viter un espÃ¨ce de saut de paragraphe introduit avant Environmentalist.
 %%EDITOR'S NOTE: Please ensure that the intended meaning has been maintained in this edit. % sss Not sure if the meaning has been maintained. The idea is that we make sure the false discovery rate stays below 5%: it is not equal to 5%. Wikipedia says: "The Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg procedure (BH step-up procedure) controls the FDR at level alpha" where level alpha is our 5% (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_discovery_rate) %% RCP NOTE: Edited to revert to the original.
% sss If we change "We can think" by "We argue" (that the degree of support...), we should also change "what determines most of the bias". Because the bias is largely idiosyncratic, and although policy support is the biggest determinant, it still explains a low share of the variance. So maybe replace "what determines most of the bias" by "what most explains the bias"? (and/or replace "We argue" by "These results suggest") %% RCP NOTE: Edited. => saej je propose qu'on fasse aussi le changement "what most explains the bias" -> ok => done daej

Overall, the biases are large and closely related to one's convictions. However, the direction(s) of the causality between beliefs and attitude towards the policy is not resolved at this stage.

\subsection{Environmental effectiveness\label{subsec:perception_ee}}

A well-established result in the literature on the acceptability of climate policies is the perceived ineffectiveness of Pigouvian instruments \citep[e.g.,][]{dresner_social_2006,kallbekken_et_al_2011, baranzini_effectiveness_2017}. In particular, people do not see carbon taxes as effective in combating climate change. Our findings confirm this result.

In our survey, we randomly elicited respondents' perceived price elasticity of either housing or transport energy for French people. To see how perceived elasticity relates to the perception of effectiveness, we run two separate regressions where the dependent variable $E$ is equal to 0 if the respondent does not perceive the policy as environmentally effective and 1 otherwise. In the first regression, we regress the perceived effectiveness on the perceived elasticity for housing, and in the second we regress it on the perceived elasticity for transport energy.

Indeed, among respondents who perceive the policy to be environmentally ineffective, almost half anticipate responses to price changes larger than those in the literature.\footnote{Overall, the average subjective elasticities are close to the estimates of the literature for transport (at $-$0.45) and somewhat overestimated for housing ($-$0.43). Among those who declared that the policy was not effective, 45\% (resp. 43\%) anticipated an aggregate elasticity at or below $-$0.5 for housing (resp. for transport), while elasticities obtained from the literature are approximately $-$0.2 for housing and $-$0.4 for transport.\label{fnel}}

A more plausible explanation for perceived ineffectiveness is that people do not believe that the policy would be sufficient to \textit{substantially} affect pollution and climate change. Taking respondents' average anticipated elasticities for transport and housing energy (that are fairly accurate\footref{fnel}), our tax \& dividend policy should reduce French greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 5.7 Mt of CO$_\textnormal{2}$ equivalents (CO$_\textnormal{2}$e) each year. This reduction corresponds to 0.8\% of French annual emissions and 0.01\% of global emissions.\footnote{The computations are based on household carbon emissions simulated from official data. In 2014, French GHG consumption-based emissions were equal to 712 MtCO$_\textnormal{2}$e \citep{cgdd_chiffres_2019}. In 2017, global emissions were 53.5 GtCO$_\textnormal{2}$e \citep{unep_emissions_2018}.} Thus, although respondents do anticipate responses to price incentives, our results suggest that they do not perceive a 50\euro{}/tCO$_\textnormal{2}$ national carbon tax to be a proportionate reaction to climate change.

It is often argued that a critical barrier to the acceptance of carbon taxation is its perceived distributional impact, in particular the higher burden imposed on lower income households \citep{bristow_public_2010,brannlund_tax_2012,gevrek_public_2015}. However, the literature has shown that redistributing the revenue of a carbon tax through uniform lump-sum transfers---i.e., a tax \& dividend---can make the policy progressive \citep{west_williams_04,bento_distributional_2009,williams_initial_2015}, including for France \citep{bureau_distributional_2011,douenne_2020}. Figure \ref{figure:effort_rate_uc} in Appendix \ref{subsec:app_distributive} displays the average net gain by income decile for our tax \& dividend. This figure shows that lower income households would gain more than richer households, both in relative and in absolute terms. However, among respondents who did not receive the information on the progressivity, only 19\% of respondents think the policy would benefit the poorest households, compared to 60\% who declare that it would not and 20\% who do not know.

The previous section has shown that people's low acceptance of our tax \& dividend correlates with pessimistic beliefs about the properties of the scheme. As knowledge about these properties has been shown to be decisive for acceptance \citep{carattini_overcoming_2018}, it is important to assess how people form their beliefs. In the following, we test respondents' reactions to information about their gains, environmental effectiveness, and progressivity. If overly pessimistic views simply reflected a lack of knowledge, we would expect them to revise their beliefs after they receive new information, which is what we refer to as ``updating''. %

\subsection{Self-interest}\label{subsec:update_si}

\subsubsection{Pessimism in the revision of beliefs\label{subsubsec:update_after_feedback}} %

% dr2 add (the \textit{ex post} belief is on average consistent with the fact that 83\% of them do in reality lose from the tax \& dividend policy), with 86\% endorsing our ``lose'' feedback. -> done  
Our respondent-specific estimation of net gains (see Section \ref{subsec:Households-surveys}) enables us to tell respondents that given their characteristics, they have a 5-in-6 chance to ``win'' or ``lose'' from the policy. We can then examine how they update their beliefs about their win/lose category after receiving this information. The full transition matrices of people's beliefs are given in Tables \ref{table:transition_matrix_positive_feedback} and \ref{table:transition_matrix_negative_feedback} in the Appendix \ref{subsec:app_perception_si}. More concisely, Table \ref{table:confidence_intervals_beliefs_feedback} reports the share of respondents whose beliefs after being informed are aligned with our feedback with the corresponding 95\% binomial confidence intervals. It shows a highly asymmetric response depending on the feedback received. On the one hand, for the 24\% of individuals who receive ``lose'' feedback $(\widehat{\Gamma} = 0)$, the \textit{ex post} belief is on average consistent with the fact that 83\% of them do in reality lose from the tax \& dividend policy, with 86\% endorsing our ``lose'' feedback. If anything, these people would rather tend to \textit{agree too much} with our noisy signal, especially when excluding people who initially consider themselves to be unaffected (i.e., focusing on $g^0 \neq 0$). On the other hand, the 76\% who received ``win'' feedback $(\widehat{\Gamma} = 1)$ appear to be much more conservative in their revision since only 25\% of them endorse the ``win'' feedback. Among the respondents who initially thought that they would lose in this group, a mere 12\% switch their answer from ``lose'' to ``win''. This is in sharp contrast to the respondents who initially thought they would win and receive ``lose'' feedback since 82\% of them endorse our prediction. Thus, pessimistic beliefs are robust to our treatment, but optimistic beliefs are not.

%%% TO AJE : "pessimistic beliefs are consistent with our treatment" : we previously had "persistent to our treatment" to convey the idea that beliefs change little even when giving an informational treatment. "Consistent with" does not preserve the intended meaning. We would like to revert to "persistent to" or something that would convey the same meaning.

%%EDITOR: Consistent was the incorrect revision. I have revised it to "are robust to our treatment".

%dr2 : "are effectively losers." -> "do in reality lose from the tax \& dividend policy".

Table \ref{table:confidence_intervals_beliefs_feedback_biased} in the Appendix \ref{subsec:app_perception_si} conducts the same analysis for the 28\% of respondents whose gain is very positive or very negative, i.e., above 110\euros{} per c.u. in absolute terms. For these respondents, our out-of-sample prediction of the win/lose category is correct in 99\% of the cases, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:proba_pred} in the Appendix \ref{subsec:app_perception_si}. The alignments with our feedback are similar between the whole sample and these respondents for whom we are certain to make a correct prediction. The similarity of alignments for different prediction accuracies rules out the possibility that a large fraction of respondents do not update their beliefs because their private information would be \textit{truly} more accurate than our prediction.

\subsubsection{Causal effect of feedback on beliefs\label{subsec:causal_feedback}} 
% dr2 La transition avec ce qui prÃ©cÃ¨de me paraÃ®t imparfaite. Je propose: In order to be relevant, our feedback on respondents' win/lose category had to be customized and as accurate as possible. This information intervention is therefore not a randomized treatment and we cannot simply compare the \textit{ex post} belief of those who received a \textit{win} vs. \textit{lose} feedback as coming from two otherwise identical groups. Despite this non-random assignment of the treatment, there is still a way to estimate the causal effect => While we have just analyzed the effect of providing \textit{information} about the respondents' net gains on their win/lose belief, we have yet to compare the effect of receiving a \textit{win} vs. \textit{lose} feedback for a given respondent. Despite the non-randomness of our feedback, there is a way to estimate the causal effect -> je ne suis pas fan de la premiÃ¨re phrase qui je trouve ne fait pas une claire distinction entre ces deux sections. Je propose : "In order to be relevant, our feedback on respondents' win/lose category had to be customized and as accurate as possible. This information intervention is therefore not a randomized treatment and we have not identified its causal effect on respondents' beliefs. Despite this non-random assignment..." => "As our information intervention was not a randomized treatment, we have yet to identify the causal effect of receiving a \textit{win} vs. \textit{lose} feedback on respondents' beliefs.

C'est pas l'effet causal de win vs. lose par contre, qu'on traite mtn. -> ok pour ta proposition, mÃªme si je pense qu'on pourrait garder la premiÃ¨re phrase qu'on a actuellement. => ok done en la gardant

% dr2 : "in a regression discontinuity design (RDD)" -> "in a RDD" (c'est dÃ©jÃ  dÃ©fini page 4).

To be relevant, our feedback on respondents' win/lose category had to be customized and as accurate as possible. Since our information intervention was not a randomized treatment, we have yet to identify the causal effect of receiving \textit{win} vs. \textit{lose} feedback on respondents' beliefs. Despite this non-random assignment of the treatment, there is still a way to estimate the causal effect of the feedback on people's beliefs. The binary win/lose feedback is a variable $\widehat{\Gamma}$ that jumps from 0 to 1 when our continuous estimation of respondents' net gains $\widehat{\gamma}$ exceeds the zero threshold. The following equation enables us to estimate the threshold effect around zero net gain in an RDD, and thus to obtain the effect of receiving \textit{win} compared to \textit{lose} feedback:


\begin{equation}
    G_i^F = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \widehat{\Gamma}_{i} + \alpha_{\gamma,1} \widehat{\gamma}_{i} + \alpha_{\gamma,2} \widehat{\gamma}_{i}^{\;2} + \mathbf{\alpha_C C_i} + \mathbf{\alpha_I I_i} + \eta_i
    \label{eq:effect_feedback}
\end{equation}

The dependent variable $G^F$ represents respondents' belief about their gain after the feedback. It is equal to 0 if they believe they lose, and 1 otherwise. $\mathbf{C}$ is a set of respondents' characteristics, and $\mathbf{I}$ a set of variables describing their household's income. The two terms $\widehat{\gamma}$ and $\widehat{\gamma}^{\;2}$ allow for a quadratic specification to control for estimated net gains to properly isolate the effect of receiving positive rather than negative feedback. To better identify the threshold effect in the RDD, we focus on the subsample of respondents whose estimated net gain $\widehat{\gamma}$ is close to zero (less than 50\euros{} per annum in absolute value). Table \ref{tab:effect_feedback} displays the results, including our main specification (column 1), the same estimation performed on the full sample (2), a modified version of (1) where interaction terms have been added to study heterogeneous treatment effects (3), and a specification where the dependent variable corresponds to the belief to \textit{win} instead of to \textit{not lose} (4).

Everything else being equal, after receiving the feedback, respondents predicted winners are 27 p.p. more likely to believe they do not lose than respondents predicted losers (column 1). They are also 15 p.p. more likely to believe that they win (column 4). Interestingly, column 3 shows that the effect of the informational treatment is heterogeneous. From the two interaction terms, we see that among the respondents who initially accepted the tax \& dividend policy---i.e., when it was first presented---the effect of the \textit{win} feedback on the belief not to lose goes from 27 p.p. to 41 p.p., while for those supportive of the Yellow Vests---who declared to be part of or to support the movement---it goes down to less than 10 p.p. Thus, the information provided to respondents is processed differently depending on their attitude towards the policy. While the treatment is rather effective at convincing those most favorable to the policy about its impact on their household, those most opposed to it do not appear to be receptive to this information.

\subsubsection{Mechanisms \label{sec:mechanisms}}

% dr2 pessimistic beliefs and attitudes => pessimistic and heterogeneous beliefs -> ok => ah je proposais "beliefs and attitudes => beliefs" aussi, pour Ã©viter deux "and" -> ok Ã§a me va, done
There are several ways to rationalize pessimistic and heterogeneous beliefs against the tax \& dividend. We propose the following four mechanisms: distrust, uncertainty, motivated reasoning, and intentional misreporting.

\paragraph{Distrust}

The first mechanism is that respondents distrust what we present to them. They may perceive our information to be biased, think that we wrongly estimated their likelihood of winning and that we are overly optimistic.\footnote{Another possibility is that respondents give too much value to their private information relative to the base rate information. That is, pessimistic winners might be overconfident in seeing themselves as specific so that they partly discard the new information, e.g., by thinking that they are part of the one-sixth for whom our prediction is erroneous, perhaps because they believe that they always lose more than others from new policies.} As a result, they may discount our new information relative to their prior or assign relatively more weight to our information when it is pessimistic. This distrust may stem from an impression that experts understate the costs of a carbon tax or that the government will break its promise to pay the dividend. For instance, \cite{sapienza_zingales_2013} report that 51\% of Americans are skeptical that their governments would deliver on using the proceeds of a carbon tax to reduce other taxes \citep[see also][]{dresner_social_2006,hsu_pollution_2008}.

%EDITOR: Corrected.
\paragraph{Uncertainty}

The second mechanism stems from people's uncertainty regarding their gain. That uncertainty would make them see their possible gain as a distribution \citep[see][]{stiglitz_addressing_2019}. Then, instead of reporting the average of this distribution, loss-averse people would conservatively estimate their gains. Also, the effect of uncertainty on updating is ambiguous. On the one hand, uncertain people could be more likely to rely on our base rate information; but on the other hand, their subjective probability of losing could remain high despite our information.%

%%% TO AJE : "loss adverse people" should be "loss averse people", right?

\paragraph{Motivated reasoning}

% dr2 added: "By analyzing ..." after \citep{kahan_ideology_2013}. -> trÃ¨s bien !

% dr2 : ajout de "even controlling for their prior belief"
The third mechanism to explain the observed asymmetry in belief revision is that some people have a strong skeptical attitude towards the carbon tax, which affects the formation of their beliefs. They would engage in motivated reasoning, i.e., update their beliefs in a way that is consistent with their initial views \citep{druckman_evidence_2019,little_distortion_2019} rather than integrate information in a way that leads to accurate conclusions. Although motivated reasoning is linked to distrust since it also involves neglecting information, in the case of distrust, people discard information because they do not trust its source; for motivated reasoning, they dismiss the information when its content contradicts preexisting views. Motivated reasoning entails a deviation from Bayesian updating---contrary to the first two mechanisms---but it can still be \textit{rationalized} as a psychological adaptation to preserve one's sense of identity \citep{kahan_ideology_2013}. By analyzing the determinants of a correct update, the online Appendix \ref{sec:heterogeneity_update} shows that those who initially disapprove of the tax \& dividend and those who are part of the Yellow Vests movement are significantly less likely to correctly update their win/lose belief after feedback (by 18 and 14 p.p., respectively), even controlling for their prior belief. This finding is consistent with motivated reasoning since political views and identity are correlated with the way people form their beliefs (see the online Appendix \ref{sec:MR} for a discussion). However, we did not demonstrated the causality, and this correlation could also stem from higher distrust (or higher uncertainty) among these groups.

%%% TO AJE : "Although distrust is linked to motivated reasoning since it also involves neglecting information" : it should be the reverse, i.e., "Although motivated reasoning is linked to distrust since it also involves neglecting information" to preserve the meaning.

%EDITOR: Corrected.

\paragraph{Intentional misreporting}

A fourth possibility is that some respondents intentionally report overly pessimistic beliefs compared to what they actually think. This could stem from a rejection of the tax and could follow from strategic thinking if they believe that their survey answers might influence policy-makers. Such respondents could be aware that they would gain but still reject the tax for other motives, even more so if they are still uncertain about their gain. Their misreporting could also be due to a type of motivated reasoning that would not directly affect their beliefs but rather induce them to misreport what they think. This could help them justify their rejection of the policy, even more so in that it could be costly for their ego to admit that they were wrong to reject the policy.

% dr2: remove the following paragraph
% Overall, these results show that people's pessimistic beliefs about the incidence of a tax \& dividend are highly persistent. This pessimism is consistent with people forming their beliefs in a motivated way. Nevertheless, other mechanisms---such as a distrust of the government---may play a key role. Further research with a different design is needed to determine the relative importance of these different mechanisms.

Table \ref{tab:update_ee} in the Appendix \ref{subsec:app_perception_ee} reports the effect of displaying relevant information on the belief that our tax \& dividend is environmentally effective. The effect of reporting a scientific consensus on environmental effectiveness ($E$) is positive and statistically significant, but its magnitude---approximately 5 p.p.---seems modest given that the question immediately follows the information intervention. The effects of information on climate change ($CC$) or particulates ($PM$) are smaller, and only $CC$ is significant, which is understandable since we displayed the information at the very beginning of the survey and it does not mention any environmental policy. As suggested by \citet{millner_beliefs_2016}, given the complexity of the mechanisms at play, drawing a causal link between the causes and consequences of environmental problems requires considerable cognitive effort, making it difficult to convince one of the effectiveness of policies that decentralize efforts to address pollution. Finally, we observe that our information interventions have no significant effect on beliefs about the causes and consequences of climate change. Overall, these treatments appear to be insufficient to change most people's minds about climate change and carbon tax effectiveness. %

\subsection{Progressivity\label{subsec:persistence-prog}}

% dr2 : "Without a deep" -> "To conclude, without a deep"

Table \ref{tab:prog} in the Appendix \ref{subsec:app-prog} reveals the absence of an effect of explaining that our tax \& dividend is progressive on perceived progressivity. The correlation between the two is close to 0 (at $-0.006$) and even has an unexpected negative sign. Column (2) of the same table clarifies why our treatment does not change the overall share of people who think that the policy is regressive. Those who have a large bias in their perception of gains are in fact \textit{more} prone to perceive \textit{regressivity} once provided the information by 13 p.p. This result may be a manifestation of the boomerang effect with people inclined to motivated reasoning, which has already been documented for Republican attitudes on climate change in the US \citep{zhou_boomerangs_2016}. Indeed, \citet{hovland_communication_1953} showed that when someone is pressured to make a certain choice, psychological reactance \citep[theorized by][]{brehm_theory_1966} can cause them to resist this pressure by adopting an opposite alternative. Although the effect on those without a large bias is not significant, providing them with information is associated with a lower perceived regressivity by 5 p.p. To conclude, without a deep explanation of the underlying mechanisms, the progressivity of the policy remains unintuitive for most people, and we cannot convince them easily.

% old : In any case, without a deep explanation of the underlying mechanisms, the progressivity of the policy remains unintuitive for most people, and we cannot convince them easily. A possible explanation for the strong belief in regressivity is that people view the tax as regressive (relative to income) and the transfer as neutral (in absolute value) and mistakenly conclude that their combination is regressive.

\section{How beliefs determine attitudes \label{sec:motives5}}

Our results clearly indicate that, at present, a carbon tax is unlikely to be accepted in France. However, we have also shown that people display overly pessimistic perceptions about the true effects of the policy. Most of them overestimate the negative impact on their purchasing power, think that the policy is regressive, and do not see it as environmentally effective. In this section, we examine to what extent the low acceptance rate reflects intrinsic preferences or incorrect perceptions. The question we address is whether convincing people about the actual incidence of the policy and its effectiveness would be sufficient to generate public support.

\subsection{Self-interest \label{sec:motive_si}}

\paragraph{Identification challenge}

% % dr2 la phrase suivante pourrait sauter "Because respondents thinking that they would win might differ in many respects from those thinking they would not, we cannot simply regress approval on perceptions of winning." -> pourquoi ? Le papier est dÃ©jÃ  assez court. => c'est que Ã§a me paraÃ®t assez Ã©vident, mais Ã§a me va de la laisser -> j'hÃ©site, parce que d'un cÃ´tÃ© il veut un truc assez court, de l'autre il veut que ce soit clair et pÃ©dagogique. Peut-Ãªtre qu'on devrait plutÃ´t modifier "we cannot simply..." pour dire un truc un peu moins Ã©vident, comme "we need a specific identification strategy to estimate the causal effect of the perception of winning on approval". => ok, done
Among the three-quarters of the respondents expected to win from our tax \& dividend, 62\% both consider that they would not win and disapprove of the policy. We want to estimate to what extent knowing that they would win would lead them to approve of the reform. Because respondents thinking that they would win might differ in many respects from those thinking they would not, we need a specific identification strategy to estimate the causal effect of the perception of winning on approval.

\paragraph{Main identification strategy}

To identify the effect of self-interest on acceptance \textit{ceteris paribus}, we exploit exogenous variations in gains and losses. To do so, we consider a tax \& targeted dividend, where respondents are randomly assigned to a compensation scheme for which they are eligible or not depending on their income (see Section \ref{subsubsec:the-survey}). Formally, we denote $I_{i,1}$ as the income percentile of respondent $i$ and $I_{i,2}$ as that of the second adult in their household if there is one. We define the eligibility of adult $j\in \left\{1;2\right\}$ as follows:\footnote{As explained in Section \ref{subsubsec:the-survey}, we explicitly limit the number of beneficiaries to two per household.}

\begin{equation}
T_{i,j} =
\begin{cases}
  0, & \text{if}\ I_{i,j} > t_i \\
  1, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $t_i\in \mathcal{T}=\left\{20;30;40;50\right\}$ is the eligibility threshold randomly allocated to household $i$ (see Section \ref{subsubsec:the-survey}). Since eligibility increases the likelihood of believing that one wins from the policy---without necessarily implying it---our method leads to a fuzzy RDD, where eligibility corresponds to the intention to treat and the respondents who believe that they will win from the tax and targeted dividend correspond to the treated. Formally, we denote $G_i^T$ as a dummy variable equal to 0 if respondent $i$ thinks that they would lose from the tax \& targeted dividend and 1 otherwise. Similarly, $A_i^T$ is a dummy variable equal to 0 if respondent $i$ disapproves of this policy and 1 otherwise. We can then write the model as a two-stage least squares with the following first-stage equation:

where $\mathbf{C_i}$ is a vector of respondent characteristics, $S_i$ is a dummy variable equal to 1 when there is a single adult in the household, and $\mathbf{I_i}$ is a vector of income variables defined as $\left(I_{i,j},\:\left(\min(I_{i,j}-k,\:0)\right)_{k=20,70}\right)^{\prime}_{j=1,2}$. $\mathbf{I_i}$ allows for a continuous piecewise linear relationship in incomes with slope changes at the 20th and 70th percentiles. We also introduce fixed effects for the policy assigned $\un_{t_i=k}$ ($k\in \mathcal{T}$) to control for preferences regarding the specificities of the policy, i.e., the share of the population targeted by the policy and the value of the dividend. To obtain more precise estimates, we control for initial acceptance of our tax \& dividend since this should explain much of the variation in the dependent variable. Finally, the second stage is written as follows:

% dr2 : "the first-stage results in Appendix \ref{subsec:app_motives_1st_stage}" -> "the first-stage results shown on Table \ref{first_stage_private_benefits} below"

\noindent
where $\widehat{G_i}^T$ denotes the fitted value of $G_i^T$ from the first-stage regression. As seen from the first-stage results shown on Table \ref{first_stage_private_benefits} below, the eligibility of both respondents and households' second adults are positively correlated with beliefs about winning, and so both instruments are relevant. The exclusion restriction states that conditional on income, being eligible affects approval solely through beliefs on winning. The RDD procedure employed in the first stage ensures that this is the case. Conditional on income, eligibility is random, and by controlling for the specific policy assigned ($\un_{t_i=k}$), it should affect acceptance only through self-interest. 

\paragraph{Alternative IV identification}
As an alternative identification strategy, we exploit a methodology similar to the main specification---i.e., a fuzzy RDD---but applied it to the customized feedback. Indeed, we use our estimation of respondents' net gains $\widehat{\gamma}$ as the assignment variable and the binary win/lose feedback $\widehat{\Gamma}$ as the intention to treat. Since our feedback $\widehat{\Gamma}$ (which jumps from 0 to 1 at the threshold of zero net gain) is predictive of the belief about the win/lose category after feedback (see Section \ref{subsec:causal_feedback}), $G^F$, we can determine the effect of this belief on acceptance after feedback, $A^F$. This alternative fuzzy RDD leads to the following two-stage least squares model:

The first stage equation thus corresponds to our main specification of the RDD estimated in Section \ref{subsec:causal_feedback} (column (1) in Table \ref{tab:effect_feedback}). The identification assumption of this second IV states that conditional on estimated net gains $(\widehat{\gamma})$---which we control for with a quadratic specification---receiving a win feedback $(\widehat{\Gamma} = 1)$ affects approval solely through self-interest. As before, we restrict our analysis to respondents close enough to the threshold by retaining only those with net gains below 50\euros{} per annum in absolute value ($\left| \widehat{\gamma}\right|<50$).

Overall, the estimated effect of self-interest indicate that believing that one would not lose increases acceptance by more than 50 p.p. (53 p.p. in our main specification).

\paragraph{Alternative specifications for robustness}

In our main specification (column 1 in Table \ref{first_stage_private_benefits}), we exclude households where none of the adults have an income from the 10th to 60th percentiles to keep only those close enough to the thresholds. In an alternative specification (2), we replicate the same estimation using the full sample. In (3), we also compare our results with a simple OLS regression on the full sample. Finally, we investigate alternative versions of the previous models in Appendix \ref{subsec:app_motives_other}. We estimate the effect of winning instead of not losing, and on approval instead of acceptance (Table \ref{tab:alternative_si}). We estimate our main specification with the slope of incomes changing at additional thresholds (30th, 40th, 50th or 60th percentile). Finally, we allow for heterogeneous effects along the income dimension (Table \ref{tab:alternative_sio}).

% dr2: remplacÃ© la longue discussion par ce petit paragraphe 
% dr2 : "simple point estimates" -> "simple OLS point estimates"
Overall, our main point estimate is robust to these alternative specifications. For example, compared to our main point estimate of 53 p.p., the full sample and simple OLS point estimates are close at respectively 48 p.p. and 44 p.p., and we find no significant heterogeneity in the effect along the income dimension.

 %%EDITOR'S NOTE: Please ensure that the intended meaning has been maintained in this edit. % sss "substantially" is more prudent but seems fine to us %% RCP NOTE: No change.
 
%old: Since we have shown in Section \ref{subsec:update_si} that respondents most likely to revise their beliefs after ``win'' feedback are less opposed to the tax, they may also be more inclined to accept the policy once they are convinced that they would win. Those most likely to comply in this setting could thus be more specific than those who comply when they are provided a (targeted) dividend that is large enough. The specificity of compliers could also explain why the average treatment effect estimated with the OLS is somewhat lower (44 p.p. in (3)), although the difference may also be due to a bias in the OLS that remains despite our powerful controls. The result of the OLS is also very close to that obtained from our main IV on the full sample (48 p.p. in (2)). The lower estimate found than in (1) could again be due to heterogeneous preferences between respondents depending on their income---with people at the bottom and top of the income distribution being less likely to revise their support when they learn that they would win---or from a less accurate identification when we enlarge the window and compare less similar respondents. Column (1) of Table \ref{tab:alternative_sio} in the Appendix confirms the existence of heterogeneous effects along the income distribution. Indeed, we find a larger effect for lower incomes, which may be due heterogeneous preferences or to the higher intensity of the treatment for low-income people (whose dividend represents a higher income share than the average).

Mais on peut garder encore une fois. -> je suis plutÃ´t pour la garder pour rester clairs quitte Ã  Ãªtre un peu rÃ©pÃ©titifs.. => ok

One of the strongest barriers to carbon tax implementation is a widespread perception of its environmental ineffectiveness. Our objective is therefore to assess to what extent learning about the environmental benefits of the tax could increase support. To identify this effect, we estimate a two-stage least squares (2SLS) model where the first stage uses random information to predict beliefs about environmental effectiveness, while the second stage regresses acceptance on the fitted exogenous variations in these beliefs. Because information on particulate matter ($Z_{PM}$) is poorly correlated with beliefs regarding effectiveness, we restrict the set of instruments to our informational treatments on the scientific consensus ($Z_{E}$) and climate change ($Z_{CC}$). Although these treatments do not have a very large effect on people's beliefs (as discussed in Section \ref{subsec:update_ee}), these instruments are significantly related to our endogenous variable. Denoting $\dot{A^0}$ as the dummy for initial approval of the tax \& dividend and $\dot{E}$ as the dummy for the belief that the policy is environmentally effective, we can write a 2SLS model as follows:

\begin{equation}
    \dot{E_i} = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 Z_{E,i} + \alpha_2 Z_{CC,i} + \mathbf{\alpha_C C_i}  + \eta_i
    \label{eq:first_stage_parametric_rdd_approve_effective}
\end{equation}

\vspace{-.6cm}

\begin{equation}
    \dot{A^0_i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \widehat{\dot{E_i}} + \mathbf{\beta_C C_i} + \epsilon_i
    \label{eq:second_stage_parametric_rdd_approve_effective}
\end{equation}

\vspace{.2cm}

\noindent
where $\widehat{\dot{E_i}}$ denotes the fitted value of $\dot{E_i}$ from the first-stage regression and $\textbf{C}$ is a vector of characteristics. Acknowledging that our information intervention could affect acceptance motives other than effectiveness alone, we include other motives in our list of control variables to avoid potential bias. % dr2 dÃ©placÃ© la 1ere phrase de robustesse Ã  la derniÃ¨re phrase de ce paragrphe

% The first-stage regression results can be found in Table \ref{first_stage_environmental_effectiveness}. Because of the relatively modest responses to our information interventions, the instruments are rather weak when broad definitions (i.e., \textit{not ``No''}) are taken in the first stage (effective F-statistic of 6), a problem that is alleviated in the case of strict definitions (effective F-statistic of 11). Table \ref{tab:ee} reports the results of the second stages. They all consistently indicate a strong positive and significant effect of beliefs about environmental effectiveness on support for the policy. All else equal, believing that the tax is effective increases the likelihood of accepting it by 51 p.p. (3) and approving of it by 42 p.p. (1). The LATE is only slightly higher than the effect estimated with OLS (2)---42 vs. 38 p.p. Given the exogeneity of our instruments, the only concern of the relative weakness of our instruments is a potential bias towards OLS, which---as suggested by the results of column (2)---would entail estimates that are too conservative in our case.  Finally, we obtain identical results when running a 2SLS or an LIML for our main specification (1). For the strict definition of effectiveness, the LIML estimate is broadly consistent with the 2SLS result (3), though somewhat higher: 64 p.p. vs. 51 p.p. (column (A2) of Table \ref{tab:eea} in Appendix \ref{subsec:app_motives_other}). -> quel est l'avantage par rapport Ã  ce qu'on a actuellement ?

The first-stage regression results can be found in Table \ref{first_stage_environmental_effectiveness}. To avoid the problem of weak instruments in our main specification, we adopt strict definitions for our variables (i.e., the answer \textit{``Yes''}, denoted by a dot, to the belief in effectiveness and approval) since they yield a higher effective F-statistic: 11 instead of 6 for broad definitions (\textit{not ``No''}). Table \ref{tab:ee} reports the results of the second stages. They all consistently indicate a strong positive and significant effect of beliefs about environmental effectiveness on support for the policy.

\paragraph{Alternative specifications for robustness checks}

In addition to the 2SLS (specification 1), we estimate an OLS (2) model with strict definitions for our variables. We also estimate other specifications with different definitions for our variables. The 2SLS in column (3) employs acceptance instead of approval as the dependent variable. In the Appendix \ref{subsec:app_motives_other}, we estimate a 2SLS with broad definitions only, as well as two OLS regressions (``Yes'' on acceptance and \textit{not ``No''} on acceptance). As a robustness check, we also report the results of a limited information maximum likelihood (LIML) estimation of our main specification in the Appendix (Table \ref{tab:eea}).

Overall, our main result is robust to these alternative specifications. The effect estimated with the OLS (2) is only slightly lower than the LATE estimated in our main specification - 38 vs. 42 p.p. Given the exogeneity of our instruments, the only concern of the relative weakness of our instruments is a potential bias towards the OLS, which---as suggested by the results of column (2)---would entail estimates that are too conservative in our case.  Finally, we obtain identical results when running a 2SLS or an LIML for our main specification (1). Regarding the strict definition of effectiveness, the LIML estimate is broadly consistent with the 2SLS result (3), though it is somewhat higher: 64 p.p. vs. 51 p.p. (column (A2) of Table \ref{tab:eea} in the Appendix \ref{subsec:app_motives_other}).

Since informing respondents does not convince them that our tax \& dividend policy is progressive (see Section \ref{subsec:persistence-prog}), we cannot perform an IV estimation to identify the causal effect of understanding the progressivity on support for the policy. In our online Appendix \ref{sec:appendix_effect_progressivity}, we estimate how one's belief in progressivity---interacted with other motives---correlates with acceptance using simple OLS and logit regressions. Controlling for many respondent characteristics and other motives for support, the effect of progressivity remains statistically significant and as high as 27 p.p. in our preferred specification. Of course, this result should be interpreted with caution since we can still suspect that the results are affected by unobserved confounders and reverse causality.

Thus, if people could be convinced on more than one motive, the tax \& dividend would presumably be supported by a large majority, although we cannot causally identify the interaction effect of several motives combined (see Appendix \ref{sec:appendix_effect_progressivity} for non causal estimates). -> trÃ¨s bien
To conclude, these results show that convincing citizens of the true incidence and effectiveness of a tax \& dividend could substantially increase support for such a policy. Extrapolating from the causal effects that we find for self-interest and environmental effectiveness, we estimate that if everyone could be convinced that the reform is environmentally effective, acceptance would reach 61\% (and approval would reach 45\%) and that if everyone could learn their win/lose category, acceptance would reach 47\%. Thus, if people could be convinced on more than one motive, the tax \& dividend would presumably be supported by a large majority, although we cannot causally identify the interaction effect of several motives combined (see the online Appendix \ref{sec:appendix_effect_progressivity} for non causal estimates). Our results also qualify the findings of \citet{anderson_can_2019}, who suggest that ideology better predicts carbon tax acceptance than self-interest. By distinguishing beliefs from preferences, our results suggest that ideology plays an indirect role by shaping beliefs about one's self-interest and that beliefs directly affect acceptance.

In this paper, we study how beliefs about a policy form and then determine attitudes towards it. We investigate this question through the study of carbon taxation in France during the Yellow Vests movement that started to protest fuel price increases. Our analysis is based on a new survey and official household survey data, enabling us to compare subjective beliefs with objective impacts on French households. We find that 70\% disapprove of a carbon tax \& dividend policy, which can be explained by pessimistic beliefs about its properties. Of our survey respondents, 89\% overestimate its negative impact on their purchasing power, and most of them do not perceive it as environmentally effective or progressive. Pessimistic beliefs appear correlated with people's support for the scheme: the more they oppose the mechanism, the more pessimistic they are. The causality between beliefs and attitudes towards the policy could actually go in both directions. People more opposed to the tax are more (pessimistically) biased in their treatment of \textit{new} information with respect to it, suggesting that political views and identity shape beliefs about the impacts of taxation. We find both that beliefs causally determine acceptance and that if people could be convinced about the incidence and effectiveness of a tax \& dividend, this policy would likely be accepted by a majority, given the large effects of these motives (approximately 50 p.p. each).%

%%% TO AJE : "In addition, we find that" : the meaning is changed. Is it ok to keep the original: "At the same time"?

%EDITOR: "At the same time" would be rather informal. I have revised the beginning of the sentence to "We find both that". You could also consider "We find that" or "We simultanesouly find that".

However, our treatments that provide accurate arguments in favor of the scheme mostly fail to convince people. The pessimism could be related to a strong distrust of the government, as documented, e.g., in \citet{alesina_intergenerational_2018} and \citet{algan_et_al_19}, echoing recent findings that the ambition of climate policies increases with the level of trust \citep{rafaty_perceptions_2018}. These results leave us with three main challenges. First, since it is unlikely that the issue of trust can be resolved in the short run, it seems necessary to find climate policies that would be accepted by a majority. We address this question in a companion paper \citep{douenne_french_2019} in which we assess both knowledge and beliefs about climate change and the preferred policies of French people. Second, since trust in the government needs to be restored in the longer run, it is crucial to analyze what causes distrust and how it can be overcome. Third, it is important to assess to what extent the mechanisms of belief formation and their effects on political attitudes we document can be generalized to other policies and other contexts. Although rejection of the tax may be lower in a different country, biases in perceptions and political polarization may occur everywhere. Thus, a lesson must be learned for policy design and implementation to avoid another carbon tax debacle \textit{à la Française}.

\section{Notations}\label{sec:notations}

% dr2 (voix passive) : "Uppercase is used for" -> "We use uppercase for"

To improve the understanding of our specifications in the regression tables, we adopt consistent notations throughout the paper. For questions where possible answers are ``Yes''/``No''/``PNR'', we define two kinds of dummy variables: the default ones correspond to \textit{not ``No''} answers, and we place a dot on dummy variables for \textit{``Yes''}. For example, acceptance is denoted by $A$ while approval is denoted by $\dot{A}$. Furthermore, for questions that are asked several times, namely, acceptance and win/lose category, an exponent is added to specify the step at which the question is asked. Table \ref{tab:notations} describes these exponents and the notations corresponding to the different notions of gain that we use. We use uppercase for binary and lowercase for continuous variables, and Greek letters denote objective notions, with a hat for our estimation of gains and without for the true (unknown) ones. To provide another example, the broad notion of self-interest at the initial step, i.e., the belief that one does not lose, is denoted by $G^0$, and the strict belief that one wins with the tax \& targeted dividend is denoted by $\dot{G^T}$. %

\section{The use of official household survey data \label{subsec:app_estimation_feedback}}

% dr2 (voix passive) : "that are used" -> "that we use"

% sss We prefer "their" than "his or her" %% RCP NOTE: Edited.
The paper employs official survey data for two purposes: (\textit{i}) computing the distribution of increases in fossil fuel expenditures and (\textit{ii}) predicting the expected net gain of each respondent based on their energy characteristics. Section \ref{appendix:official_surveys_insee} presents the three official surveys from Insee (the French national statistics bureau) that we use. Section \ref{appendix:formulas} details the formulas needed to compute the value of the dividend and households' expected net gains from their expenditures. Section \ref{appendix:estimation_feedback_regression} explains how by using two distinct surveys, we can obtain a simple formula to predict respondents' net gain simply based on their energy characteristics and then test the likelihood of making a correct prediction out-of-sample. Finally, Section \ref{subsec:app_distributive} displays the objective net gain of the policy by income decile to show that it is progressive.
\subsection{Official household surveys from Insee \label{appendix:official_surveys_insee}}

\paragraph{Consumer survey ``Budget de Famille''}

% dr2 (voix passive) : "is that expenditures on both housing and transportation energy are reported." -> "is that it reports expenditures on both housing and transportation energy."

% dr2 : "Consumption of housing energy is taken from households' bills" -> "Housing energy expenses are determined from" (expenses est plus prÃ©cis que consumption qui fait plutÃ´t rÃ©fÃ©rence Ã  une quantitÃ© qu'Ã  un montant de dÃ©pense)

The consumer survey (\href{https://www.insee.fr/en/metadonnees/source/serie/s1194}{BdF 2011}) is a household survey providing information on all households' revenues and expenditures, together with many sociodemographic characteristics. It was conducted in several waves from October 2010 to September 2011 on a representative sample of 10,342 French households. The main advantage of the BdF when studying the incidence of carbon taxation is that it reports expenditures on both housing and transportation energy. Housing energy expenses are determined from households' bills, and for most other goods, respondents report their expenditures over the past week. However, as explained in \citet{douenne_2020}, this data collection is problematic when examining the incidence of a tax on transportation energy since short-run fluctuations in consumption lead to overestimation of the heterogeneity in expenditures.

\paragraph{Transport survey ``Enquête Nationale Transports et Déplacements''}

To overcome this limitation, the BdF is matched with the transport survey (\href{https://www.insee.fr/en/metadonnees/source/serie/s1277}{ENTD 2008}). The ENTD was conducted in several waves from April 2007 to April 2008 on a representative sample of 20,178 French households. It provides information on household characteristics, vehicle fleets and use over the past week, but most important, it provides information on the annual distances traveled with these vehicles. This last information enables us to recover the distribution of transport fuel expenditures without overestimating its spread. Such matching is not necessary for housing energy since it already represents consumption over long periods in the BdF.

\paragraph{Housing survey ``Enquête Logement''}

The housing survey (\href{https://www.insee.fr/en/metadonnees/source/serie/s1004}{EL 2013}) was conducted from June 2013 to June 2014 on a sample of 27,137 households in metropolitan France. It includes considerable information on households' characteristics, as well as their housing energy bills. The distribution of energy expenditures is very close to that of the BdF.

\subsection{Formulas to compute monetary effects of carbon tax policy \label{appendix:formulas}}

To compute the monetary impact of a carbon tax increase on household $h$, we decompose current energy expenditures $E_h(\tau)$ as a product of current price $P(\tau)$ and current quantities consumed $Q_h(\tau)$, each being a function of the excise tax $\tau$ of which the carbon tax is  a part:\footnote{The French carbon tax ``Contribution Climat Energie'' is a component of existing taxes on energy products: TICPE for transport and heating oils, and TICGN for natural gas.} %%EDITOR'S NOTE: Please ensure that the intended meaning has been maintained in this edit. % sss Seems fine.
$$
E_h\left( \tau \right) = P\left( \tau \right) Q_h\left(\tau\right)
$$
% dr2: number eq + Small variations in expenditures can then be expressed as => Using a first-order approximation, small variations in expenditures can then be expressed as

% dr2 (voix passive) : "small variations in expenditures can then be expressed as" -> "we can then express small variations in expenditures as"

\noindent
Using a first-order approximation, we can then express small variations in expenditures as follows:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dE}
\frac{dE}{E}\left(\tau\right) = \frac{dP}{P}\left(\tau\right) + \frac{dQ}{Q}\left(\tau\right)
\end{equation}

% dr2 (voix passive) : "The variation in quantities can be rewritten as" -> "We can rewrite the variation in quantities"
% dr2 (voix passive) : "the final price can itself be decomposed as" -> "we can decompose the final price itself as"

\noindent
We can rewrite the variation in quantities as a function of the price variation:

$$
\frac{dQ}{Q} \left(\tau \right) = e\frac{dP}{P}\left(\tau\right)
$$
\noindent
where $e = \frac{dQ_h}{dP} \cdot \frac{P}{Q_h}$ is the price elasticity of the energy good considered, which is assumed to be constant and identical across households. For all energy types, we can decompose the final price itself as follows:
$$
P\left(\tau\right) = \left(p+i\tau\right)\left(1+t\right)
$$
\noindent
where $t$ is the value added tax (VAT) rate (assumed constant) that applies after excise taxes, $i$ is the incidence of excise taxes on consumers (assumed constant), and $p + \left(i-1\right)\tau$ is the producer price as a function of $\tau$.\footnote{Hence, $p$ is the producer price when $\tau = 0$.} When the carbon price changes so that the excise taxes vary from $\tau$ to some level $\tau'$, we therefore have the following: %

$$
\frac{\Delta P\left(\tau\right)}{P}
= \frac{P\left(\tau '\right) - P\left(\tau\right)}{P\left(\tau\right)}
= \frac{\left(p + i \tau '\right)\left(1+t\right) -  \left(p + i \tau\right)\left(1+t\right)}{\left(p + i \tau\right)\left(1+t\right)}
= \frac{i\left(\tau' - \tau\right)}{p + i \tau}
$$

\noindent
% sss we don't obtain the first-order approximation here, but three equations above. Back to "carrying on the first-order approximation" or something similar would be better. %% RCP NOTE: Edited.

% dr2 : "one can express" -> "we can express"

Thus, by carrying on the first-order approximation, we can express an increase in expenditures associated with a carbon price increase as follows:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:formula_expenditures}
    \Delta E_h\left(\tau\right) = E_h\left(\tau\right)\left(1+e\right) \frac{\Delta P}{P} = E_h\left(\tau\right)\left(1+e\right) \frac{i\left(\tau' - \tau\right)}{p + i \tau}
\end{equation}

\noindent
We can replicate similar calculations to obtain the expected variations in the tax paid on energy by household $h$, $\Delta T_h$. Starting from the expression for $T_h$---which is the sum of excise taxes and the VAT on the energy good---we have the following:
$$
T_h\left(\tau\right)
= Q_h\left(\tau\right) \bigg(\left(1+t\right) \tau + t \big(p + \left(i-1\right)\tau \big) \bigg)
$$
\noindent
From this, we obtain the following:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:formula_dividend}
    \Delta T_h\left(\tau\right) = Q_h\left(\tau\right) \left( 1 + e \frac{i\left(\tau' - \tau\right)}{p + i \tau} \right) \bigg( t \big(p + \left(i-1\right)\tau' \big) + \left(1+t\right) \tau' \bigg) - Q\left(\tau\right) \bigg( t \big(p + \left(i-1\right)\tau \big) + \left(1+t\right) \tau \bigg)
\end{equation}

\noindent
Finally, the net gain of a household $h$ from a tax \& dividend is written as follows:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:formula_net_gain_app}
    \gamma_h(\tau) = N^a_h \cdot \frac{\sum_h \Delta T_h(\tau)}{N^a} - \Delta E_h^{transport}(\tau) - \Delta E_h^{housing}(\tau)
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $\gamma_h$ denotes its net gain from the policy, $N^a_h$ is the number of adults receiving the dividend in this household, $N^a$ is the total number of adults receiving it, and $\Delta E_h^{transport}$ ($\Delta E_h^{housing}$) is the increase in their expenditures on transport (housing) energy. From households' energy expenditures and making assumptions for the elasticities and tax incidence, equations (\ref{eq:formula_expenditures}) to (\ref{eq:formula_net_gain_app}) enable us to obtain the value of dividends and the impact of the policy on households' purchasing power. We use equation (\ref{eq:formula_net_gain_app}) to estimate the biases and objective distribution of net gains in Section \ref{sec:perceptions} and the customized feedback in Section \ref{sec:persistence}.

When asked to estimate the impact of the policy on their own purchasing power, respondents simply had to make an estimation over:

%%% TO AJE : "to make an estimation using the following" : we initially had "to make an estimation over", because they must estimate the object at the left hand side, but not necessarily using the right hand side. Can we go back to the previous formulation, or something else that would preserve the correct meaning?

%EDITOR: Your orignal formuation is fine. I have reinserted it.

$$
\Delta E_h\left(\tau\right) = E_h\left(\tau\right)\left(1+e\right) \frac{\Delta P}{P}
$$

\noindent
where, for simplicity, $\Delta P$ was given for transport fuels, and $\frac{\Delta P}{P}$ was given for housing energy. Thus, they were not required to make any specific assumption about existing taxes or tax incidence but simply to estimate their consumption and price elasticity.

\subsection{Predicting gains and losses\label{appendix:estimation_feedback_regression}}

% dr2 : section modifiÃ©e : ajout de l'explication et de l'Ã©quation Ã©quation (i.e. Ã  partir de "To do so, we use" et jusqu'Ã  "All specifications yield"). Je pense que c'est suffisant pour compenser ce qui a Ã©tÃ© supprimÃ© dans le corps du texte.

% dr2 (voix passive) : "the coefficients obtained can then be used to" -> "we can then use the coefficients obtained to"

As explained in Section \ref{subsec:Households-surveys}, to estimate respondents' bias and provide customized feedback on their win/lose category, we need to estimate the increase in their housing energy expenditures, $\Delta E_h^{housing}$, based on their energy characteristics. To do so, we use the housing survey \emph{Enquête Logement} (EL 2013), which provides information on household expenditures on housing energy and many demographic and energy characteristics. It enables us to compute $\Delta E^{housing}$ and regress it on household characteristics. We can then use the coefficients obtained to compute $\widehat{\Delta E}^{housing}$ (and thus obtain $\widehat{\gamma}$) for any household. The specification we chose is as follows:

\begin{equation}
\label{formula_reg_net_gain}
    \Delta E^{housing}_h = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \chi^G_h + \beta_2 \chi^F_h + \beta_3 \sigma_h + \epsilon_h
\end{equation}

% sr2 : "shows the out-of-sample error rate, computed with the consumer survey as explained in Section \ref{subsec:Households-surveys}" -> on l'explique moins maintenant. Je pense tout de mÃªme que ce qu'on dit est suffisant et ne nÃ©cessite pas d'ajouter plus d'explication ici, mais je suis pas certain non plus. => oui Ã§a va je pense

\noindent
where $\chi^G_h$ (resp. $\chi^F_h$) is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the household uses gas (res. heating oil) for heating and $\sigma$ is the size of the household's accommodation in square meters. The results are provided in Table \ref{tab:reg_housing} together with those of other specifications. The last row of the Table \ref{tab:reg_housing} shows the out-of-sample error rate, computed with the consumer survey, as explained in Section \ref{subsec:Households-surveys}. All specifications yield a similar error rate of 15-17\%. Given the concern that respondents could make mistakes when reporting their accommodation size in the entry field, we used the first specification in our survey since it does not rely as heavily as the others on the accommodation size. To balance the error rates for losing households that are mistakenly estimated to be winners and for winners who are mistakenly estimated to be losers, we add a constant of 16.1 in our estimation for the yearly net gain, which is thus the sum of 16.1 plus 110 times one or two (depending on the number of adults) minus increases in transport and housing energy expenditures. We selected the OLS as our prediction method for the estimation of the net gain because it compares well to alternative methods. We also classified winners and losers using a decision tree and obtained a very close error rate: 17.4\%. Finally, statistical matching provided an error rate of 17.7\%.

%%% TO AJE : "household's accommodations in square meters" : households have one main accommodation, do you confirm that we should write "accommodations" and not "accommodation" ?

%EDITOR: The singular, as you suggest, is better here. Revised.

% old : To do so, we regress $\Delta E_h^{housing}$ on households' characteristics using the housing survey. Table \ref{tab:reg_housing} presents several specifications of this regression, and its last row shows the out-of-sample error rate, computed with the consumer survey. All specifications yield a similar error rate of 15-17\%. Given the concern that respondents could make mistakes when reporting the accommodation size in the entry field, we used the first specification in our survey, as it does not rely as heavily as the others on the accommodation size. To balance the error rates for losing households that are mistakenly estimated to be winners and for winners who are mistakenly estimated to be losers, we add a constant of 16.1 in our estimation of yearly net gain, which is thus the sum of 16.1 plus 110 times one or two (depending on the number of adults) minus increases in transport and housing energy expenditures. We selected OLS as our prediction method for the estimation of net gain because it compares well with respect to alternative methods. We also classified winners and losers using a decision tree and obtained a very close error rate: 17.4\%. Finally, statistical matching provided an error rate of 17.7\%.

\subsection{Elasticities}

% dr2 : "perceived elasticity relates" -> "perceived elasticities relate"
% dr2 : "to perceive the policy" -> "to perceive the tax \& dividend policy"

% tr2 : Ici aussi on peut dire qu'on explique mieux les questions utilisÃ©es. edit!

% dr2 : ajout du paragraphe ci-dessous (prÃ©cÃ©demment en 3.2)
To see how perceived elasticities relate to the perception of effectiveness, we run two separate regressions where the dependent variable $E$ is equal to 0 if the respondent does not perceive the policy to be environmentally effective and 1 otherwise. In the first regression, we regress the perceived effectiveness on the perceived elasticity for housing; and in the second, we regress it on the perceived elasticity for transport energy. Table \ref{table:elasticities_effectiveness} below reports the results with and without control variables. They all consistently indicate that perceived elasticities are correlated with beliefs about the policy's effectiveness since for both sectors a respondent anticipating an elasticity of $-$1 is (on average) 6 p.p. more likely to perceive the tax \& dividend policy to be effective than one anticipating no elasticity. Although significant, the magnitude of the effect is modest, showing that the perceived ineffectiveness of tax instruments should not be attributed to small subjective elasticities.

Before starting, please read carefully the information below on particulate
matter pollution: 
\end{enumerate}
\begin{itemize}
\item particulate matter is responsible for 48,000 deaths in France each
year; 
\item particulate matter reduces the life expectancy of French people by
9 months; 
\item reducing fuel consumption would reduce the health problems associated
with particulate matter. \\

\\
Please read carefully the information below on climate change. \\
\end{enumerate}
\begin{itemize}
\item Climate change is already responsible for 150,000 deaths annually.
\item If greenhouse gas emissions continue on their current trend, the average
global temperature increase will be +5°C in 2100 and +8°C in 2250. 
\item A rapid transition to renewable energies is technically possible and
would contain global warming at +2°C. 
\end{itemize}
According to scientists, in the absence of ambitious measures, 
\begin{itemize}
\item a large proportion of species will face an increased risk of extinction,
\item natural disasters will intensify (hurricanes, heat waves, droughts,
floods, forest fires, etc.); 
\item by 2100, 270 million more people would be flooded each year due to
sea-level rise; 
\item violent conflicts and migration flows can be expected to increase.

%%% TO AJE: in the questionnaire, many details are added in the formulations (e.g. "the following"). Is it ok to keep the original version, to stay closer to the original phrasing in French?

%EDITOR: Yes, these revisions were made to provide greater formality, including the technical requirement that a colon must be preceded by an independent clause. However, in reflecting survey material, leaving those changes out and allowing for greater fidelity to the original is acceptable. I have removed most of these revisions and kept only those that seemed necessary for gramatical correctness or proper understanding.

\section{Heterogeneity in pessimism and motivated reasoning (\emph{For online publication})\label{app_heterogeneity}}

\subsection{Heterogeneity in pessimism\label{sec:heterogeneity_update}}

%dr2 : "To understand more about the determinants" -> "To better understand the determinants"
%dr2 : "To address the notion of" -> "To measure" : effectivement c'Ã©tait bizarre ce "address".
%dr2 : "over the initial belief" -> "on the initial belief"
% dr2 (To better understand..) above pessimism => pessimistic updating of the win/lose category
To better understand the determinants of the pessimistic updating of the win/lose category, we investigate the heterogeneity in updating. To measure \textit{correct updating}, we define a variable $U$ that equals $+1$ if the respondent adopts feedback that invalidates their initial belief, $0$ if they do not update, or $-1$ if they initially felt \emph{unaffected} but update as being against the feedback. Over the subsample of \textit{invalidated} respondents who should have updated because their initial win/lose category is not aligned with our feedback ($g_i\cdot\widehat{\gamma}_i \leq 0$), we regress the \textit{correct updating}, $U$, on the initial belief not to lose, $G^0$, and a vector of characteristics, \textbf{C}: %

\begin{equation}
	U_{i} = \delta_{0}+\beta_{U}G^0_{i}+\mathbf{\beta_C C}+\epsilon_{i}\hspace{0.3cm} \text{for}\,i:\,g_i\cdot\widehat{\gamma}_i \leq 0,
\end{equation} %

%dr2 : "update more correctly" -> "are more likely to update correctly"
%dr2 : "also appear to update less correctly." -> "appear also to be less likely to update correctly."
% dr2 The reason previous characteristics could be correlated with people's uncertainty. => The reason why previous characteristics affect the likelihood of correctly updating remains unclear. It is possible that they are correlated with people's uncertainty about their net gains. 

\noindent
The high values for $\beta_{U}$ reported in columns (1-3) of Table \ref{tab:heterogeneity_update} again prove that among those who should have updated, those who initially thought that they would win (the optimistic losers) update significantly more correctly than those who did not think so (the pessimistic winners). Beyond this asymmetry, columns (2-5) show that some respondent characteristics are correlated with correct updating. Relative to unemployed and inactive people, retired, active, and students are more likely to update correctly, the latter being 22 p.p. more likely to correctly revise their beliefs when they are invalidated than unemployed and inactive people (column 2). The categories of respondents who initially displayed the largest bias appear also to be less likely to update correctly. Indeed, people who are part of the Yellow Vests movement are 14 p.p. less likely to correctly update than people who oppose it, even when controlling for disapproval of the policy, which itself decreases the likelihood of correctly updating by 18 p.p. The reason why previous characteristics affect the likelihood of correctly updating remains unclear. It is possible that they are correlated with people's uncertainty about their net gains. Alternatively, the Yellow Vests' greater distrust of the government \citep[documented in][]{algan_et_al_19} could also apply to information on policies provided by researchers. Finally, these results also indicate that motivated reasoning may be at play.

% dr2 pointing out the importance of motivated reasoning => indicating the presence of another mechanism, such as motivated reasoning
The previous results suggest that conservatism in belief revision does not simply follow people's cognitive difficulties when dealing with Bayes' rule. The greater likelihood of correct updating for those who support the reform indicates that political views and identity can shape belief formation. Indeed, the more people oppose the tax, the less likely they are to correctly update, as shown in columns (2-5) of Table \ref{tab:heterogeneity_update}. From columns (4-5), we also see that this result is entirely driven by the ``pessimistic winners'': the updating of people who wrongly think that they will win does not depend on their approval, which is another indication that the revision in beliefs is driven by a rejection of the tax. This is not to say that few people seek to reach accurate beliefs. It still could be the case that informing any respondent that they would win makes them revise their subjective gain by, say, 100\euros{} upwards, leading only those with small subjective losses to discover that they would win.\footnote{Those with small subjective gains who discover that they lose would similarly correctly update. Those with large subjective losses would not update while virtually no respondent has a large subjective gain. This would explain the asymmetry in the updates.} One can actually see from the positive and statistically significant effect of \textit{subjective gain ($g$)} that such an accuracy motive is at play. However, this effect remains small relative to those indicative of policy support, indicating the presence of another mechanism, such as motivated reasoning. Column (3) further shows that the effect of approving the policy on correct updating is even stronger for more educated people---since the interaction term between approval and diploma is positive and significant---even capturing the entire effect of initial policy approval. % dr2 initial tax approval => initial policy approval

%%% TO AJE : why is "effects" in plural form in "capturing all the effects"?

%EDITOR: I have revised this to "the entire effect", which I believe better captures your meaning.

% dr2 first evidence of rational motivated reasoning => first case for rational motivated reasoning
The previous findings are comparable to empirical evidence from \citet{kahan_ideology_2013} that politically motivated reasoning about climate change is not a reasoning deficiency but rather a reasoning adaptation following the interest that individuals have in conveying ``their membership in and loyalty to affinity groups central to their personal well-being''. In our case, the position relative to the Yellow Vests proxies for the groups that respondents identify with, and the differentiated updating along this spectrum can be interpreted as motivated reasoning. In addition, the hypothesis that motivated reasoning follows from a rational adaptation purpose can explain our finding that better educated people are \textit{more} prone to motivated reasoning since they are better able to formulate specious reasoning and reconcile antagonistic information and ideas. To the best of our knowledge, this result is the first case for rational motivated reasoning in the context of climate policies, complementing the findings of \citet{druckman_evidence_2019} that this mechanism can explain polarization around beliefs on climate change.\footnote{This evidence provides empirical support for various models of endogenous belief formation. For example, \citet{little_distortion_2019} formalizes the idea that directional motives may override accuracy motives and that people update their auxiliary beliefs (in our case, the win/lose category) to preserve their consistency with their core beliefs (here, rejection of the tax). Admittedly, one might expect the importance of accuracy motives relative to directional motivated reasoning to increase in a higher stakes environment. However, this hypothesis cannot be tested in our setup, and previous literature does not provide conclusive evidence on the matter \citep{ziva_kunda_case_1990,camerer_hogarth_1999}.}

Building upon the cognitive and social mechanisms described by \citet{kraft_why_2015} and documented by, e.g., \citet{redlawsk_hot_2002}, we hypothesize the following narrative as one of the possible channels through which aversion to the carbon tax became entrenched. The Yellow Vests first gathered to defend their interest (above all, their purchasing power), and a side effect of the daily interactions on roundabouts was to bring material and emotional support to the protesters \citep{challier_rencontres_2019}. A group identity soon developed, which crystallized shared beliefs and affects such as a rejection of carbon taxation. This group identity gained support from a large majority of the population, notably through social networks. Now, due to the loyalty to the group and affects that have entered their subconscious, Yellow Vests supporters instinctively oppose any carbon tax and are prone to find excuses to cope with contradictory messages, e.g., by denying the reliability of these messages \citep{golman_preference_2016}. Admittedly, such a narrative falls short of explaining the majority rejection among those who oppose the Yellow Vests (which may originate from pessimistic perceptions more than tax aversion), but it illustrates how pessimistic beliefs can be so persistent among Yellow Vests supporters.

Overall, the persistent pessimism is consistent with people forming their beliefs in a motivated way. Nevertheless, other mechanisms---such as a distrust of the government---may play a key role. Further research with a different design is needed to determine the relative importance of these different mechanisms.

\section{Relation between support and belief in progressivity (\emph{For online publication})\label{sec:appendix_effect_progressivity}}

\paragraph{Specifications used}

%dr2 : "to our priming on" -> "to our information intervention on"

As noticed in Section \ref{sec:effect_progressivity}, the ambiguous responses to our information intervention on progressivity do not allow us to perform an IV estimation to identify the causal effect of this motive. To explore how respondents' beliefs about progressivity relate to their support for the policy, we therefore estimate simple OLS and logit regressions. Even though we control for many variables, including beliefs over other motives of support, we may suspect that the coefficients obtained remain biased by omitted variables or reverse causality. They should therefore be taken as partial correlations and not causal estimates.

We focus on the acceptance question \textit{after information}, i.e., after asking whether the reform is progressive or not. Table \ref{tab:progressivity} presents the results of different regressions, depending on the set of controls and on the choice of variables. Columns (1)-(4) report regressions of acceptance on the broad definition of motives of acceptance: answers \textit{not ``No''} to progressivity, effectiveness and \textit{not ``lose''} to win/lose category. On the contrary, columns (5)-(6) use strict definitions for both approval and the covariates, where only \textit{``Yes''} (or \textit{``win''}) answers activate the dummy variables.

\paragraph{Results}

%dr2 : "priming on climate change" -> "information intervention on climate change"

On average, believing that the reform is \textit{not regressive} is associated with a higher \textit{acceptance} rate by 56 p.p. (column 3) while believing it is \textit{progressive} is associated with a higher \textit{approval} rate by 48 p.p. (6). However, when one introduces other motives of acceptance and their interactions as covariates, with households characteristics as controls, one observes that the effect of progressivity is lower: its marginal effect at the sample mean - i.e., accounting for the average marginal effect of interaction terms - is 27 p.p.\footnote{Although these results are not causal, they show that 90\% of those who believe in the three motives approve of the policy, along with 65-75\% of those who believe in two of them.} To disentangle the link between beliefs over net gains and progressivity, we also include the interaction between progressivity and income as a covariate (2, 5). Although the coefficient is negative, in accordance with intuition, the effect is small and not significant. Adding the powerful control of initial policy acceptance in column (2) has a negligible influence on the effect of progressivity of 24 p.p. (instead of 27 p.p.), which validates our choice of the preferred specification (1). Despite the powerful control, column (2) is not our preferred specification because the effect of environmental effectiveness is mostly captured by the covariate ``initial policy acceptance'' since the information intervention on climate change predated the initial question on acceptance. Finally, using the strict definitions of beliefs and approval yields a smaller correlation (6) but similar results when accounting for relevant controls (5), showing that the effects are not driven by a correlation between ``PNR'' answers. Overall, although these results are not causal, they suggest that the belief that the tax is progressive is associated with a higher support, all else equal.

%%% TO AJE : "by 24 p.p.": the meaning is altered compared to the original "at 24 p.p.", no? The effect we are talking about here is the effect of progressivity, not of policy acceptance.

%EDITOR: I have revised this to "of 24 p.p.".

\section{Willingness to pay  (\emph{For online publication})}\label{sec:WTP}

For respondents who believe in the effectiveness of our Tax \& Dividend, we are able to infer their willingness to pay (WTP) for climate mitigation by studying the acceptance rate as a function of subjective gain. We adopt a common practice in the literature and define the WTP as the monetary loss that the \textit{median} agent is willing to incur \citep{hanemann_welfare_1984}. Figure \ref{fig:WTP} indicates that this WTP is about 60\euros{}/year per c.u. since this corresponds to the subjective loss below when a majority accepts the policy. This WTP is computed only among people who believe that the tax is not ineffective since it would make little sense to assume that some people are willing to pay for an instrument that does not achieve its expected goal. Indeed, Figure \ref{fig:WTP} shows that the ``WTP'' of the whole sample is zero, meaning that the median person accepts the policy only when they personally gain from it. Our method has several advantages. First, it can be interpreted as a willingness to accept as much as a willingness to pay because our instrument is neither framed as a good to buy nor as damage to be compensated for, and net gains do not distinguish cost increases from payments received. Second, our method is more akin to revealed preferences - and hence probably less biased \citep{murphy_meta-analysis_2005} - than previous ones because most studies directly ask respondents to select their preferred option for climate mitigation, be it using a contingent valuation method \citep{berrens_information_2004,cameron_individual_2005,kotchen_willingness--pay_2013} or a discrete choice experiment \citep{longo_internalization_2008,alberini_preferences_2018}. Still, our estimation has two notable limitations relative to the literature: it relies on a non-representative subsample, and subjective gains are endogenous from acceptance. 

%%% TO AJE : is it normal to have "below in which"?

%EDITOR: I believe "below when" is better and have made this revision.

To compare our estimation with those of the literature, expressed per household, we have to multiply our WTP by the average number of consumption units in households: 1.6. The WTP per household we get, 96\euros{}, lies in the typical range of the literature \citep{jenkins_political_2014,streimikiene_review_2019}, suggesting that the protests against carbon taxation encountered in France do not reflect specific preferences for environmental policies.

For the whole sample (blue curve), this majority acceptance is reached only when subjective gains are positive. This refers back to Section \ref{subsec:Survey-Beliefs-climate}.} \caption{Acceptance rate by subjective gain, informative of the willingness to pay for climate mitigation.\label{fig:WTP}}} %

\section{Ensuring data quality (\emph{For online publication})}\label{app:speed} %

We took several steps to ensure the best possible data quality. We excluded the 4\% of respondents who spent less than 7 minutes on the full survey. We confirm that our main results are robust to choosing another cutoff than 7 minutes (see Table \ref{tab:7min}). In order to screen out inattentive respondents, a test for the quality of the responses was inserted, which asked respondents to select ``A little'' on a Likert scale. The 9\% of respondents who failed the test were also excluded, which yields a final sample of 3,002 respondents. Also, when the questions about a reform were spread over different pages, we recalled the details of the reform on each new page. We checked for careless or strange answers on numerical questions, such as income or the size of the household. We flagged 10 respondents with aberrant answers to the size of the household (and capped it to 12) and up to 273 respondents with inconsistent answers, such as a household income smaller than individual income, or a fuel economy higher than 90 liters per 100 km. Being flagged and response time are not significantly correlated with our variables of interest such as policy support or subjective gain (the correlation is always from $-$1\% and 3\%). An examination of the flagged answers suggests that these respondents simply misunderstood the question. Among these inconsistent answers, 58 respondents have answered more than 10,000\euros{} as their monthly income (despite the word ``monthly'' being in bold and underlined), with answers in the typical range of French annual incomes. We have divided these figures by 12. 

%%% TO AJE : "... or having a low response time is correlated ..." alters the meaning compared to "... or response time are correlated ..." because the variable we use is continuous, not dichotomous. Maybe changing "are" to "is" suffices?

%EDITOR: You are correct. I have revised the phrase to "Being flagged and response time are not significantly correlated".

%%% TO AJE : is the meaning preserved when changing "have mistaken" to "misunderstood"? We are afraid the notion of mistake is lost.

%EDITOR: I read your meaning as being that the flagged respondents reported income for the wrong period, despite the request for monthly information being made clear in the question. "Mistaken the question" does not really work in English, and it seems to me that "misunderstood" conveys your meaning. However, you could also consider "misinterpreted the question".
