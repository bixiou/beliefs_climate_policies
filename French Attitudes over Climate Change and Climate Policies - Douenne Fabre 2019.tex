This paper aims to assess the prospects for French climate policies after the Yellow Vests crisis halted the planned increase in the carbon tax. From a large representative survey, we elicit knowledge, perceptions and values over climate change, we examine opinions relative to carbon taxation, and we assess the support for other climate policies.

The paper also studies in details the determinants of attitudes in terms of political and socio-demographic variables. Among many results, we find limited knowledge but high concern for climate change. We also document a large rejection of the carbon tax but majority support for stricter norms and green investments and reveal the rationales behind these preferences. Our study entails policy recommendations, such as an information campaign on climate change. Indeed, we find that climate awareness increases support for climate policies but no evidence for the formation of opinions through partisan cues as in the US, suggesting that better access to science could foster support for the ecology.

\section{Introduction}

The French government is currently facing a double-sided challenge on climate policies. On the one hand, the protest of the Yellow Vests that originated in November 2018 against the planned doubling in the carbon tax  --- from 44.6 to 86.2\euro{}/tCO$_2$ in 2022 --- led the government to halt the increasing trajectory. On the other hand, a large campaign called \href{https://laffairedusiecle.net/}{``Affaire du siècle''} started in December 2018 against its inaction for the environment, gathering over two millions signatories in a month. It is so far unclear how the tension between these two \textit{a priori} antagonistic objectives will be resolved. In particular, one may wonder whether the two movements involve distinct groups with opposite interests, or rather reflect a commonly perceived inadequacy of the solution proposed by the government to the climate threat.

This paper aims to understand French perceptions over both climate change (CC) and the policies that should be implemented to tackle it. To do so, we conducted a new survey on a sample of 3,002 respondents representative of the French population. Our survey contains questions to assess respondents' knowledge about CC and their perceptions over its causes, consequences, and the timing of its effects. As the paper was primarily motivated by the failed attempt to increase the French carbon tax, we examine in detail attitudes towards this instrument. To do so, we propose respondents a Tax \& dividend policy, i.e. a carbon tax whose revenue would be returned lump-sum uniformly to all adults. This policy differs from the one proposed by the government, since the revenue would have been used to fund the general budget instead. We identify respondents' expected winners and losers, and the perceived problems and benefits of this instrument. We devote particular attention to the issue of mobility that appears critical in the current debate. We then turn to the support for a carbon tax with alternative uses of the revenue, such as more targeted transfers, earmarking, and double-dividend strategies. We also study the support for other climate policies, including norms and other Pigouvian taxes, and local policies for urban transport. Finally, we identify the determinants of attitudes over both climate change and climate policies, as well as the link between the two.

Our paper contributes to a growing literature on the political economy of climate policies. To get a glimpse on previous related studies, we refer to \citet{drews_van_der_bergh_2016} who review the determinants of the support for climate policies and to \citet{carattini_overcoming_2018} for a comprehensive overview on attitudes over the carbon tax. For a general presentation of attitudes over climate change, we point out \citet{whitmarsh_2_2018}, while for a more specific review on their trends and determinants, we redirect to \citet{brechin_public_2010}. The present paper contributes to the literature by providing a comprehensive analysis of the determinants of attitudes about climate change and climate policies in a country that has recently experienced a carbon tax increase and a large debate ensuing.

%The paper therefore contributes to the literature by providing a comprehensive analysis of the political and socio-demographic determinants of perceptions about climate change and climate policies in a country that , and how the former may affect the latter.

% Since France recently experienced a large debate over the carbon tax, the issues covered in the survey are not hypothetical questions but refer to policy discussions that people are aware of. The paper also contributes to the literature by providing a comprehensive analysis of the political and socio-demographic determinants of perceptions about climate change and climate policies, and how the former may affect the latter.

%Our results indicate that redistributing the revenue of the tax directly to households --- instead of using it to fund the general budget --- would not have solved the acceptability problem. Even in this scenario people express concerns about the distributional effects of the tax, and doubt its efficacy. However, 

Section \ref{sec:survey} presents the survey. Section \ref{sec:attitudes_climate_change} describes attitudes towards climate change. Section \ref{sec:attitudes_carbon_tax} focuses on Tax \& dividend, its perception, and the reasons explaining the low support for this policy. Section \ref{sec:attitudes_other_policies} studies the support for alternative revenue recycling mechanisms as well as for other climate policies. Section \ref{sec:determinants} examines the heterogeneity in attitudes expressed in the previous sections and characterize its determinants. Finally, section \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes.

\section{The survey}\label{sec:survey}

    \subsection{Presentation of the survey}

We collected 3002 responses in February and March 2019 through the survey company Bilendi. This company maintains a panel of French respondents whom they can email with survey links. Respondents are
paid 3\euro{} if they fully complete the survey. The respondents who choose to respond are first channeled through some screening questions which ensure that the final sample is representative along six socio-demographic characteristics: gender, age (5 brackets), education (4), socio-professional category (8), size of town (5), and region (9). The quotas are relaxed by 5\% to 10\% relative to actual proportions. Table \ref{tab:Sample-Characteristics} in Appendix \ref{app:Raw-Data} shows that our sample is still extremely representative. Nonetheless, observations are weighted to correct small differences between sample and population proportions. The median time for completion of the survey was 19 minutes. 

The full survey in French can be seen \href{http://preferences-pol.fr/doc_q.php#_e}{on-line},\footnote{\href{http:\/\/preferences-pol.fr\/doc\_q.php\#\_e}{preferences-pol.fr/doc\_q.php\#\_e}} the questions analyzed are translated in Appendix \ref{app:questionnaire}, and the code is available on \hyperlink{https://github.com/bixiou/beliefs_climate_policies}{github}. Figure \ref{fig:survey} presents in a diagram the sequence of  questions.

% with a priming where information on climate change or on particulate matter is randomly displayed or not. This priming divides the sample in four groups, who receive either one block of information, the other, none or both of them. Then, we ask 
% motivate why tax & dividend
% other paper: energy usage, transportation energies TODO
The survey starts by asking for households' socio-demographic and energy usage. The distribution of answers are much in-line with official statistics, as shown in Table \ref{tab:app-energetic-characs} in Appendix \ref{app:Raw-Data}. Then, we describe Tax \& dividend reforms where the revenues of an increase in the French carbon tax by 50\euro{}/tCO$_\textnormal{2}$ are redistributed uniformly to all adults. We first allocate respondents randomly to a sectoral Tax \& dividend reform, which concerns either gas and domestic fuel (i.e. housing energies), or gasoline and diesel (i.e. transportation energies). Respondents are asked to estimate their reaction to price changes, the reaction of French people, and how much purchasing power they would gain or lose from the policy. To this end, exact price variations and the amount transferred are provided, and respondents can choose among answers given in different brackets. Then, we study perceptions and support for a Tax \& dividend on both sectors combined, before and after providing new information to the respondents. This new information is either that the policy is progressive, or whether their household would win or lose some purchasing power through the reform. Before providing information, we let respondents pick the categories of losers and winners from the reform; and after the information, they pick the reasons why this reform seems beneficial, and undesirable. We study these perceptions of the policy in the present paper, but we refer to our companion paper \citep{douenne_can_2019} for details and analyses on the other questions about Tax \& dividend reforms. % %and where respondents are asked to estimate their own elasticity as well as that of French people. To this end, we borrow the phrasing of \citet{baranzini_effectiveness_2017}, and ask the expected decrease in consumption that would follow a 30\% increase in the price of heating (or equivalently, an increase of 0.50\euro{} per liter in fuel prices), among 5 brackets. 

% The survey starts by asking for households characteristics. In addition to the quotas strata, socio-demographic characteristics include zip code, household structure, income of the respondent and of their household. Energetic characteristics contain surface of accommodation, heating type (collective or individual) and energy source; as well as the number of vehicles, type(s) of fuel, distance traveled last year and average fuel economy. The distributions of answers are much in-line with official statistics, as shown in Table \ref{tab:app-energetic-characs} in Appendix \ref{app:Raw-Data}.

    \subsection{Eliciting attitudes towards climate change and climate policies}

After inquiring about the support for Tax \& dividend, we ask respondents to assess on a Likert scale different ways to recycle the revenues of a carbon tax. On another Likert scale, we scrutinize opinions on other climate policies, notably new norms or Pigouvian taxes. We then measure respondents' knowledge about climate change by asking if they can identify its origin (anthropic or natural), its causes (in terms of gases and activities), which region it will most affect (between India and the European Union), and what reduction of emissions is needed for 2050 to respect the +2\textdegree{}C target. At the same time, we assess attitudes over climate change by asking respondents about the frequency with which they talk about it, the gravity of its consequences, the generations it will severely effect, and the entities responsible for its occurrence. We continue by surveying if and how climate change influences one's decision to have a child, under which conditions one would be ready to change their lifestyle to fight climate change, and whether one would be ready to adopt a sustainable lifestyle if all policies were aligned to this goal. We also ask questions on shale gas and diesel taxation. Then, we evaluate the respondents access to public transport, their mobility habits, and if there is room for changing these habits. Finally, we ask for their political preferences, including their positioning in relation to the Yellow Vests. The survey ends with a text box where the respondent can leave a comment.

\section{Attitudes over Climate Change\label{sec:attitudes_climate_change}}
    
    \subsection{Knowledge\label{subsec:knowledge}}

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:cause}, the share of French people who do not believe in climate change (CC) is marginal (4\%), and the proportion who prefer not to respond (PNR) is small (6\%). Overall, knowledge that CC is anthropic is widespread (72\%), despite wording expected to provide a lower bound on this figure \citep{motta_experimental_2019}. The level of knowledge on the anthropic origin of CC is similar to that of other Western countries \citep{leiserowitz_international_2007,lee_predictors_2015,stokes_global_2015-1}: it is for example 66\% in the U.S. \hyperlink{https://news.gallup.com/poll/1615/environment.aspx}{(Gallup, 2019)}. However, knowledge on climate science appears limited. Although 77\% of people correctly tick ``CO$_\textnormal{2}$'' as a greenhouse gas (GhG), Figure \ref{fig:factors} shows that almost as many people tick particulate matter (39\%) as methane (48\%). This mistake likely reflects a common confusion between air pollution and climate change, both conflated to the broader notion of ``pollution''. Admittedly, understanding the impacts of activities is more useful than erudition about chemical factors, but here again, knowledge is quite low. We assess such awareness using pairs of comparable activities whose GhG footprint differ by a factor 20 (beef steak vs. pasta, plane vs. train) or whose footprint are similar (nuclear vs. wind power).\footnote{Appendix \ref{app:footprint} details how the figures were obtained.} We ask whether it is true that one activity emits 20 times more GhG than the other, as a way to express precisely that one is ``much more'' polluting than the other. For each pair, around half of the sample is correct. The bulk of respondents pick two correct answers out of three (44\%), but more get it all wrong (19\%) than all right (15\%). Figure \ref{fig:region} shows that, although five times more people (correctly\footnote{See e.g. vulnerability indexes of \citep{climate_vulnerable_forum_climate_2012,guillaumont_measuring_2015,closset_physical_2018}.}) believe that India will face more serious climate impacts than the European Union, 65\% still think that both regions will face as much damage. 

Not only do most people fail to fully understand the factors and consequences of CC, but they also fail to grasp the degree of reaction needed to tackle it. When taught that ``each French person emits on average the equivalent of 10 tons of CO$_\textnormal{2}$ per year'' and asked what should be the figure in 2050 to ``hope to contain global warming to +2\textdegree{}C in 2100 (if all countries did the same)'', 59\% answer 5 or more (see Figure \ref{fig:target_emission}). Only 17\% select a correct answer: 0, 1 or 2 (see Appendix \ref{app:sources} for why these are correct).

\label{fig:target_emission}
\end{figure}

\citet{millner_beliefs_2016} propose several mechanisms to explain people's lack of understanding about climate change: in addition to the difficulty to grasp slow moving changes, they emphasize the complexity of drawing a causal link between diffuse causes and distant consequences. Failing to assimilate the underlying channels may blur the link between people's own behavior and consequences for the climate. One related element that may explain why people ignore the basics of climate science is that they do not feel directly affected by CC. In fact, 62\% think that the first generation seriously affected by CC is yet to be born (Figure \ref{fig:generation}). %Furthermore, the hypothesis that learning is motivated by perceived personal prejudice is substantiated by the correlation between knowledge and perception of affected generations. Indeed, a delay of one generation as the first affected by CC is significantly associated with a lower knowledge by 0.1 standard deviation, where knowledge is measured by an index formed with the variables presented in this subsection (see Section \ref{sec:determinants_attitudes_policies}).\footnote{That being said, the result that most French people do not see their generation as a victim of CC should be tempered with the finding from \hyperlink{https://news.gallup.com/poll/1615/environment.aspx}{Gallup (2019)} that 45\% of American think that ``global warming will pose a serious threat to [them] or [their] way of life in [their] lifetime'' (to the extent that both countries are comparable).}

\end{figure}

    \subsection{Opinions\label{subsec:opinions}}
% Suggestion!: keep wording after disastrous and grave?
Even though many French people might not think they will suffer themselves from CC, a vast majority foresee worrying consequences if humanity did nothing to limit it. Figure \ref{fig:gravity} shows that 19\% see the impacts as ``cataclysmic, humankind would disappear'', 18\% as ``disastrous, lifestyles would be largely altered'', 28\% as ``grave, because there would be more natural disasters'', while only 11\% think damages would be ``small, because humans would be able to live with it'', ``insignificant, or even beneficial''. These results echo a survey from \citet{ademe_representations_2018} which shows that 63\% of French people think that ``living conditions will be extremely harsh'' in France in 50 years and that 57\% do not think CC ``will be limited to acceptable levels by the end of the century''. Despite --- or perhaps due to --- a broad hopelessness, 34\% almost never talk of CC (Figure \ref{fig:talks}). 27\% talk of CC several times per month, which can give a sense of the share of people who regularly engage in long-term thinking. The relatively low amount of discussion for an issue largely perceived as a serious threat may be a way to flee from one's moral duty and to protect one's lifestyle.\footnote{As a recent literature has shown, people tend to discard information perceived as bad news and display what \citet{sharot_et_al_2011} call ``unrealistic optimism in front of reality''.} Indeed, 63\% acknowledge that ``each one of us'' is responsible for CC, and less people return the responsibility to ``certain foreign countries'' (47\%), to ``the richest'' (42\%), or to any other agent (see Figure \ref{fig:responsible}).

% Note: there is also a general tendency to discount one’s own contribution to causing climate change and identify causes of climate change primarily with other people or countries (Lorenzoni & Pidgeon, 2006; Whitmarsh, 2009) (found in Whitmarsh)

% Note: a 1988 survey found that more than three-quarters of respondents were already worried about climate change, rising to almost nine in ten by 1992 (Eurobarometer, 1992). From Whitmarsh 18

Overall, these results indicate that most people understand the fundamentals of climatic issues, including the root causes and the scale of the problem, but that only a minority has thought of CC deeply enough to know its factors and the pathways to tackle it.

\end{figure}

    \subsection{The Reaction Needed\label{subsec:reaction}}
    
Given that many people may not realize the extent of the transition needed to reach sustainability, and that others may be discouraged precisely by the sheer size of such a transition, we can wonder how willing people are to contribute to its success. An encouraging finding for the transition is that 65\% are ``willing to adopt an ecological lifestyle (i.e. eat little red meat and make sure to use almost no gasoline, diesel nor kerosene)'', ``assuming that all states in the world agree to firmly fight climate change, notably through a transition to renewable energy, by making the richest contribute, and imagining that France would expand the supply of non-polluting transport very widely'', while only 17\% answer ``No'' (the others do not take a side). While the phrasing removed most grounds against a change in lifestyle, we inquired under which conditions would people be willing to adopt such a change (see Figure \ref{fig:condition}). It may be a manifestation of warm glow or of the lack of knowledge on the efforts needed, but 36\% affirm that they have ``already adopted a sustainable way of life'' and/or that they ``try to do so'', while only 11\% refuse to change their lifestyle (and barely 2\% justify it by their self-interest). 82\% of respondents would be willing to change their lifestyle under at least one of the three conditions proposed: sufficient financial resources, an alignment of policies to this goal, or of people's behavior (about 45\% each).

% Pew: 75\% American concerned by CC (Funk Pew 2016)
Other French representative surveys find similar results, and indicate which efforts people are most ready to make.\footnote{\hyperlink{http://www.datapressepremium.com/rmdiff/2008572/Etude-OpinionWay-pour-PrimesEnergie.fr.pdf}{OpinionWay} survey was conducted in March 2019 on a representative sample of 1,042 French adults, and \citet{ademe_representations_2018} in September 2018 on a representative sample of 1,557 French adults.} 
\citet{ademe_representations_2018} shows that the efforts people make or could easily make are also the least efficient to reduce GhG emissions: most cite waste sorting (89\%) or buying seasonal vegetables (87\%), but fewer mention walking or cycling (55\%) or using public transport (49\%) instead of driving. Logically, 62\% thus think that ``only legislative constraint is effective in making a successful transition and forcing everyone to change their consumption habits'' (\hyperlink{http://www.datapressepremium.com/rmdiff/2008572/Etude-OpinionWay-pour-PrimesEnergie.fr.pdf}{OpinionWay, 2019}).

\section{Attitudes over Carbon Tax and Dividend} \label{sec:attitudes_carbon_tax}

%Objective of this section: in the companion paper we show that people reject the tax because they are biased. We focused on three critical determinants. Beyond these motives, we want to understand more how people perceive the carbon tax, and what makes them reject it.

%In our companion paper we assess respondents beliefs over the tax properties, in particular over their self-interest, the tax's effectiveness and progressivity. 

Most French people are aware and concerned about climate change, and claim to be willing to exert efforts to fight it. Yet, the government's attempt to introduce a carbon tax to deal with French emissions resulted in a widespread popular protest. To understand this paradox, our survey presents to respondents a Tax \& dividend policy: an increase of 50\euro{}/tCO$_2$ of the current French carbon tax, with a uniform lump-sum redistribution of the additional revenue to all adults. This policy differs from the official one whose revenue was mostly used to fund the general budget. Respondents are given the associated increase in energy prices so that the direct costs are salient: $+13\%$ (resp. $+15\%$) for gas (resp. domestic fuel), and $+0.11$\euro{} (resp. $+0.13$\euro{}) for a liter of gasoline (resp. diesel). They are also told that the transfer would amount to 110\euro{} per adult and per year. %In this section we examine people's perception about the policy, in particular the associated problems and benefits, as well as the category of people who would win or lose according to them.

    \subsection{Massive rejection}

% dire que les gens sont biaisés et renvoyer vers l'autre papier. 

French people would largely reject the proposed policy. Only 10\% of our respondents declare they would approve it, while 70\% say they would not (see Figure \ref{fig:approval}). As shown in our companion paper \citep{douenne_can_2019}, this massive rejection can be explained by erroneous perceptions about the policy's outcome, such as an overestimation of its impact on one's purchasing power. For instance, 30\% think their household would lose from an increase in taxes on gas and domestic fuel redistributed to all, among those who use neither of these. Interestingly, the salience of costs appears critical in people's answer. At a later stage of the survey, we ask respondents whether they would agree to increase the carbon tax if the revenue was returned to all households, without mentioning the impact on prices. The question is asked along with a package of other environmental policies (see section \ref{sec:attitudes_other_policies}). In this case --- where the benefits are more salient than the costs --- we find a much higher approval rate of 37\%. Another survey conducted in March 2019 (\hyperlink{https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ne1nUsJJqY1PYFOs9dH9uK6mLw39R1QY/view}{OpinionWay, 2019}) assesses acceptance for a \textit{return} of the increase of the carbon tax by 2021. They find intermediary results, with 21\% of people approving against 77\% opposing it (2\% ``PNR'').

Another survey (\hyperlink{http://www.datapressepremium.com/rmdiff/2008572/Etude-OpinionWay-pour-PrimesEnergie.fr.pdf}{OpinionWay, 2019}) has also assessed acceptance for a carbon tax. Their phrasing differs from ours as they do not make the policy costs salient nor specify the rate of the tax increase and the use of the revenue. They still found comparable results, with 21\% of people approving an increase of the tax in 2020, and 77\% opposing it (2\% ``PNR''). At a later stage of the survey, we also ask whether people would agree to increase the carbon tax if the revenue would be returned to all households, without expliciting the price increase. In this case, where the benefits are more salient than the costs, we also find a higher approval rate of 37\%.

% Note: attention plusieurs sondages opinionway en mars 2019

The low level of acceptance observed partly follows from the recent experience. In July 2018, before the protests of the Yellow Vests, \citet{ademe_representations_2018} found that 48\% of French people thought is was desirable to increase the carbon tax, a figure similar to those of other countries \citep{brechin_public_2010}. At that time, the carbon tax had been in place for more than four years, but low oil prices made its existence little known. Few months later, in a context of higher barrel prices, the tax was put under the spotlight and its associated costs became more salient, fostering the strong opposition.

% Yale p. 16 show evidence that it is influenced by salience of costs, as 61% support a carbon tax on fossil fuel companies whose revenues would pay down the national debt, but 39/66 support increase by 0.25$/gallon to reduce federal income tax or 38/56 if it costs $180/year per household or 43/26 if tax refund given to every household. -> Les deux politiques diffèrent trop pour que l'on puisse réduire la différence de soutien à la saillance des coûts.

    \subsection{Perceived winners and losers}

Figure \ref{fig:winners_losers} represents the share of respondents who expect different households categories to win or lose from the policy. Income appears to be the most critical divide, with a non-monotonic relationship. 30\% of respondents expect the richest to win while only 2\% think they would lose. On the contrary, 40\% more people think that the poorest would lose rather than win, a difference even higher for the middle class --- the category most often expected to lose --- at 53\%. To half of respondents, we framed the question about winners and losers specifically in terms of ``purchasing power''. The objective was to see if some categories were commonly seen as losing in welfare although they could gain in monetary terms, or conversely. The results look very much alike for both formulations, except that the shares of people expecting poorer households to gain (5.8\%) and richer households to lose (0.9\%) are significantly larger for purchasing power: 10.2\% and 2.1\%, respectively. Overall, respondents perceive Tax \& dividend as regressive. As shown by a large body of literature \citep[e.g.][]{west_williams_04,bento_distributional_2009,williams_initial_2015}, and more specifically in our companion paper \citep{douenne_can_2019}, these beliefs are at odd with the true distributive effects of the proposed policy. % since poorer households net gains exceed on average those of richer households.
% : 5.8\% of people expect poor households to win, but 10.2\% expect them to win in monetary terms. Conversely, only 0.9\% expect rich households to lose, but 2.1\% to lose financially.

Beyond the income dimension, people tend to identify city dwellers as potential winners from Tax \& dividend (third position at 19\%), while rural and peri-urban households are rather expected to lose (third position at 34\%). We also see that people report on average more categories for expected losers than winners, 1.74 vs. 1.16. The high ranks of ``no one'' for winners (second) and of ``everyone'' for losers (fourth) further suggest that people do not see our policy as a zero-sum game. % unclear that no/every one are excluded.

    \subsection{Perceived pros and cons}

% dire que la taxe envisagée réduirait les émissions de façon marginale -> on le dit plus bas, à voir si on le déplace ici

% This belief that the tax would be ineffective is shared by 66\% of respondents, while only 17\% do think it would be effective (18\% ``PNR''). -> on pourrait éventuellement le mettre en footnote.

Previous studies have highlighted that distributive effects are a critical determinant of carbon tax acceptance \citep[e.g.][]{kallbekken_saelen_2011,brannlund_tax_2012,gevrek_public_2015}. When asked about the main problems associated with Tax \& dividend, the first answer coming up is that the tax would penalize rural households (47\%). Interestingly, this concern comes before the threat that the tax could penalize the poorest (sixth position with 29\%) although more people report the poorest as a category of people expected to lose. The second and third concerns are that the policy is just a pretext to increase taxes (43\%) --- a worry documented by \citet{dresner_social_2006} and \citet{klok_et_al_2006} --- and would be ineffective to reduce pollution (37\%). Related to this last point is the perceived lack of alternatives, seen as insufficient or too expensive (31\%). This problem has been previously stressed by \citet{kallbekken_aasen_2010} in a focus group study: people do not see the point of taxing fossil fuels if they cannot substitute for other technologies. This last reason is stated as frequently as concerns over the impact on one's own purchasing power (fourth with 31\%). As shown in \citet{douenne_can_2019} self-interest largely affects acceptance of Tax \& dividend, but this concern could sound too egoistic when stated in a direct way. While previous studies have pointed out concerns about the negative impact of carbon taxation on the economy \citep[e.g.][]{thalmann_public_2004,carattini_green_2017}, this problem comes last (14\%) and does not seem to represent an important obstacle for public support in the current context. % instead of "France", parce que des auteurs montrent que le soutien varie avec la conjoncture -> Ok oui ça aurait peut-être été différent il y a quelques années

% The second and third concerns are that the policy is just a pretext to increase taxes (43\%) --- a worry documented by \citet{dresner_social_2006} and \citet{klok_et_al_2006} --- and would be ineffective to reduce pollution (37\%). These two reasons are stated more frequently than concerns over the impact on one's own purchasing power (fourth with 31\%). As shown in \citet{douenne_can_2019} self-interest largely affects people acceptance of Tax \& dividend, but this concern could sound somewhat egoistic when stated in a direct way. A last important perceived problem is the lack of alternatives, seen as insufficient or too expensive (31\%). This problem had been previously stressed by \citet{kallbekken_aasen_2010} in their focus group study, and is intrinsically linked to beliefs of ineffectiveness.

Respondents are suggested to pick at most three answers among both problems and benefits. On average, respondents pick 2.36 problems --- and 53\% pick at least 3 --- against 1.14 benefits, excluding the most popular: ``None of these reasons'' (44\%). This option comes way ahead of the second and third, ``fight climate change'' (30\%) and ``reduces negative impact of pollution on health'' (27\%). Still, environmental consequences are much more cited than economic ones. This result is likely due to people's pessimism about the outcome of the policy but might also translate the limited importance given to economic consequences of the carbon tax, as already suggested by answers for potential problems. %  --- if only a few actually anticipate economic benefits ---

    \subsection{Consumption and mobility constraints}

The perceived problems identified above suggest a rationale for people's opposition towards carbon taxation: if people think the tax is ineffective, because their consumption is constrained and affordable alternatives are lacking, then taxing carbon can be perceived as a pretext to increase taxes. % narrative

    \subsubsection{Perceived elasticities}

In order to understand to what extent people feel constrained with respect to their energy consumption, we elicit their subjective price elasticity for transport and domestic energies. To do so, we adopt the phrasing of \citet{baranzini_effectiveness_2017} and ask the expected decrease in energy consumption that would follow an increase in prices. To avoid to deal with too small percentages, that people usually feel more difficult to compare, we ask for the reaction to a 30\% increase in the price of heating (or equivalently, an increase of 0.50\euro{} per liter in fuel prices). Although sufficiently high to foster a significant response on demand, these changes are realistic in the medium run and should not lead people to report long-term elasticities. Respondents may select their answer among 5 brackets. They are asked to estimate their own reaction, as well as that of French people. Figure \ref{fig:elasticities_agg} presents the results.

\end{figure}

% Note: 40\% of people expect...: give stat for fuel? -> the stat works for both: 34/(100-20)=42.5, 24/(100-37)=38
54\% (resp. 61\%) of respondents consider that such increase in prices would not lead them to reduce their transport (resp. domestic) energy consumption. This expected inelastic behavior is mainly due to mobility constraints for transport (64\% of cases) while it mostly reflects a non-fossil heating type for housing (61\%). Excluding people reporting an inelastic behavior because of too low initial consumption, about 40\% of people feel constrained and expect not to lower their consumption following price increases. Still, respondents perceive transport fuel price elasticity of French people at $-0.45$ on average, and their own elasticity at a consistent $-0.36$ (after re-weighting by fuel expenditures). Concerning housing energies, aggregate and personal subjective elasticities are respectively $-0.43$ and $-0.33$. Overall, these subjective elasticities compare well to the ones found in the literature for French households, although they are slightly over-estimated (in absolute value) for housing.\footnote{For transports, estimates from the literature lie around $-$0.4 \citep{clerc_marcus,bureau_distributional_2011,douenne_vertical_2018}. For housing, the values are lower, typically around $-$0.2 \citep{douenne_vertical_2018,clerc_marcus}.}

% Old : Overall, these subjective elasticities compare well to the ones found in the literature for French households: around $-$0.45 for transport fuels \citep{clerc_marcus,bureau_distributional_2011,douenne_vertical_2018} and $-$0.2 for housing \citep{douenne_vertical_2018,clerc_marcus}.

%\citet{douenne_vertical_2018} found very close estimates for the uncompensated price elasticity of transport fuels, at $-$0.45, in the typical range of the literature \citep[e.g.][]{clerc_marcus,bureau_distributional_2011}. For housing energies, the subjective values reported tend to exceed common estimates that rather lie around $-$0.2 \citep{douenne_vertical_2018,clerc_marcus}. This result is possibly due to the lack of salience of domestic energy prices and the hassle to replace equipment, hence the low actual response in the short-run to variation in prices despite people's intended reaction.

% Note: 45\% of respondents see themselves as strictly more constrained than average for fuel consumption, which is close with the objective share of households who spend more fuel than average: 41\%. Correlation of 0.22 between . 

% Suggestion: 50% correlation between own and aggregate elasticities, suggesting that people understands well their own reaction but wrongly project it on the whole population.

    \subsubsection{Mobility and public transport}
    % Suggestion: références dans le doc.

To assess the level of dependence to automobile, which we include as a determinant for preferences in Section \ref{sec:determinants}, we study mobility habits and access to public transport. Figure \ref{fig:transports_use} indicates that 65\% of employed people drive to work, and that use of car is even more common for grocery shopping or leisure activities. This figure is confirmed by the national transport survey \hyperlink{http://www.progedo-adisp.fr/enquetes/XML/lil-0634.xml}{ENTD (2008)} conducted by Insee and analyzed in \cite{pappalardo_mobilite_2010}, which reveals that a majority still uses car for trips of 1 to 2 km. Even though 73\% live within 10 minutes walk of a public transit stop (Figure \ref{fig:transports_distance}), coverage and frequency of public transport is often too low (Figure \ref{fig:transports_frequency}) to compete with the speed, comfort and flexibility of automobile. Indeed, 58\% of those who commute by car declare that they could neither substitute it by public transport nor walking or cycling, and only 15\% could use one of these alternative without big difficulties (Figure \ref{fig:transports_work}). Further evidence indicates that the lack of alternatives is a main driver for the use of car, besides a manifest taste for a vehicle that remains a symbol of freedom. Figure \ref{fig:transports_opinion} shows that 52\% of respondents state that supply of public transport where they live is ``insufficient'' or ``decent, but should be increased'', while 40\% find it ``satisfactory'' or ``limited, but sufficient''. From this perspective, ``green public investments and carbon taxes appear to be complementary, and in the timing of climate policy it would be justified to carry out the former before implementing the latter'', as \cite{bureau_pour_2019} put it. Together with an increase in the supply of alternatives, climate policies could also address the demand for mobility, e.g. by revitalizing town centers and limiting urban sprawl.

% Our answers mix objective and subjective characterisation of public transport supply to account for the variation in expectations for the supply depending on the density of an area. On the objective side as well, nearly half of people with an opinion find the supply ``limited'' or ``insufficient'' (48\%).

Sur les 65\% de répondants qui se rendent en voiture à leur travail, 58\% affirment ne pas pouvoir s'y rendre en transports en commun, à pied ou à vélo, et seuls 15\% pourrait utiliser un de ces modes de transport alternatif ``sans grande difficulté''.

\section{Attitudes over Other Policies}\label{sec:attitudes_other_policies}

The previous section has shown that Tax \& dividend was largely rejected by French people. As climate policies are urgently needed, it appears necessary to assess whether other designs and instruments would meet a higher support. This section first examines public opinion about several alternative use of the carbon tax revenue, and then turns to other environmental and climate policies.

    \subsection{Preferred Revenue Recycling}

%A large body of literature has shown that people tend to see Pigouvian taxes as ineffective to reduce pollution \citep[e.g.][]{dresner_social_2006,kallbekken_et_al_2011, baranzini_effectiveness_2017}. Our companion paper confirms this result, shows that people also wrongly see Tax \& dividend as regressive, and overestimate its impact on their own purchasing power. As we these biases have been shown detrimental for acceptance, we can wonder whether other uses of the revenue would lead to similar opposition. To answer this question, w
We asked respondents to what extent they would accept an increase of the carbon tax for different uses of the revenue. As the exact cost of the tax was not specified, the benefits of the revenue recycling were made relatively more salient, explaining a higher acceptance rate as compared to our Tax \& dividend. Still, this question enables to compare answers relative to one another.

        \subsubsection{Investments in energy transition}

%people who would approve raising the carbon tax in this case
%a large body of literature
% The financing of non polluting transports comes first with 65\% of approval. Investments in renewable energies and thermal renovation of buildings come third and fourth with approval rates of respectively 59\% and 56\%. 
Figure \ref{fig:recycling} reports people's response for each proposed scenario. Overall, the preferred revenue recycling are the ones investing in the energy transition. This result is consistent with many papers showing that earmarking the revenue of the tax for environmental purposes largely increases public support \citep[for a review of the literature, see for instance][]{kallbekken_aasen_2010,carattini_overcoming_2018}. As people tend to see carbon taxation as effective only if it finances green investments \citep{saelen_kallbekken_2011}, these mechanisms legitimate the implementation of a tax and increase acceptance. In addition, the large approbation for a policy investing in non-polluting transports can be explained by people's will for mobility alternatives, the lack of which was identified as an important problem of Tax \& dividend (see section \ref{sec:attitudes_carbon_tax}). 

% Old: The large approbation for a policy investing in non-polluting transports can also be explained by people's will for mobility alternatives. Among the 31\% of households who selected the lack of alternatives as a problem of Tax \& dividend (see section \ref{sec:attitudes_carbon_tax}), the approval rate for a carbon tax invested in non polluting transports goes up from 65\% to 71\%, with only 13\% disapproving.

\end{figure}

        \subsubsection{Transfers to households}
% As discussed in section \ref{sec:attitudes_carbon_tax}, the approval rate (37\%) still exceeds the one initially obtained for our Tax \& dividend policy, since the emphasis in this question is on the transfer and the costs are not salient. When targeted to the bottom 50\% of the income distribution, these transfers are slightly more approved (46\%) although this alternative ranks only seventh out of nine.
While the literature has shown that distributive concerns matter for carbon tax approval, the common tools proposed by economists to address this issue --- lump-sum transfers --- do not meet a large support. Out of the nine proposed mechanisms, the standard flat recycling comes last (with 37\% approval), and a transfer targeted to the bottom 50\% comes seventh (46\%). Consistent with our previous finding that people are concerned that the carbon tax may penalize rural and peri-urban households, the preferred ``lump-sum'' transfer is the one targeted to people constrained with respect to their consumption of petroleum products (fifth with 55\% approval). These results echo the findings of \citet{kallbekken_et_al_2011} who showed that people tend to prefer more narrowly targeted revenue recycling, possibly because of distributional concerns. % -> ok pour la modif

The relatively low support for compensation mechanisms should however not be understood as a lack of concern about purchasing power or distributive effects. As shown in section \ref{sec:attitudes_carbon_tax}, the distributive properties of lump-sum transfers are not well understood. Perhaps surprisingly, the second preferred mechanism for revenue recycling is a reduction in the VAT rate (61\% approval). The main rationales for this support are the benefits for one's purchasing power, and the perceived distributive effects. As the VAT is known to be a regressive tax, people may judge fair to compensate an increase in the regressive carbon tax by a decrease in the VAT. Although such mechanism would be less favorable to poorer households --- who spend less in VAT in absolute value, and would therefore receive less than from a uniform transfer --- it may not be perceived as such. % and therefore chosen over lump-sum transfers.

        \subsubsection{Double dividend and public deficit}

The last two options propose to use the carbon tax revenue to reduce social contributions, or the public deficit. These mechanisms come respectively in sixth and eighth position with 51\% and 44\% of approval. These results can be linked to the low level of concerns regarding the impact of a carbon tax on the economy documented in section \ref{sec:attitudes_carbon_tax}. They are also consistent with previous focus group studies \citep[e.g.][]{kallbekken_aasen_2010}, including in France where \citet{deroubaix_rise_2006} found that people did not understand why the revenue of an environmental tax reform should be used to tackle unemployment.

    \subsection{Other Instruments}

% From Voxeu article by Levinson : "Austin and Dinan (2005) show that the CAFE standards cost 2.4 to 3.5 times as much as a simple tax on gasoline that would reduce carbon emissions by the same amount. Jacobsen (2013) finds that the CAFE standards cost seven times as much as a comparable gasoline tax." - "Energy efficiency standards are more regressive than energy taxes (Levinson 2018)"

%The recent bad experience of the French carbon tax has likely made policy makers reluctant to re-introduce this instrument in the short run. If it is important to think about preferred revenue recycling to improve the design of a future carbon tax, we also need to consider alternative policies. 
Although economists have shown that alternative instruments are usually less cost-effective than Pigouvian taxes \citep[e.g.][]{goulder_parry_2008}, they may become relevant in a context where there is a binding acceptability constraint. To elicit people's preferred environmental policies, we ask respondents whether they would support eight different propositions. To ease the answer to these questions, the exact mechanisms and their associated costs and benefits are unspecified. The answers reported should therefore be taken cautiously as people could change their mind once faced with clear trade-offs. Still, this exercise is informative about people's first reactions to different proposals.

        \subsubsection{Other Pigouvian taxes}

%One explanation for the perceived ineffectiveness of Pigouvian taxes is that people believe that their consumption is close to inelastic. In our companion paper, we show that although perceived elasticity is significantly related to perceived ineffectiveness, it is far from being sufficient to explain it. The alternative interpretation we propose is that people could think the tax as effective to reduce their consumption, but not to deal with climate change. In other words, the pollution due to French cars and domestic heating are seen as small as compared to global emissions.\footnote{In \citet{douenne_can_2019} we estimate that a 50\euro{}/tCO_$_2$ carbon tax in France would reduce national emissions by 0.8\% (consumption based), that is 0.01\% of global emissions.} Thus, people could still perceive as effective a Pigouvian tax with a wider scope. The results of figure \ref{fig:policies} support this idea.
%  (where we specify it would apply to aviation)
Figure \ref{fig:policies} shows that among the eight options, the third most approved (70\%) is a tax on kerosene. It is also --- and by far --- the option receiving the most strong support (41\% of ``Yes, completely''). The main rationales could be the high perceived effectiveness of the tax, if people see aviation as an important source of emissions, and the distributive effect of such policy as richer people fly more.\footnote{In France in 2008, people in the top income decile travelled by plane about seven times more than the bottom 50\% of the income distribution \citep{pappalardo_mobilite_2010}. Furthermore, kerosene's emissions are taxed only through the EU-ETS, hence at a far lower rate than diesel and gasoline. This discrepancy has been highlighted in the public debate.} In sharp contrast, only 17\% of our survey respondents approve a tax on red meat, a policy ranked second-to-last. One can explain this lower acceptance rate by a belief that such policy would be ineffective, as we have shown in section \ref{sec:attitudes_climate_change} that less than half of respondents know that beef has a high carbon footprint. Additional motives of rejection could be the perceived negative impact on purchasing power, and the feeling that the policy is too coercive and targets a behavior difficult to change \citep{de_groot_schuitema_2012}. Overall, these evidences confirm that people are not opposed to Pigouvian taxes \textit{per se}, and that acceptance varies much depending on the target and the perceived outcome of the instrument.

        \subsubsection{Norms}

Among all proposed instruments, the two most approved are norms. 72\% and 70\% of respondents declared being in favor of stricter standards for the insulation of new buildings and for the pollution of new vehicles, respectively. It is unclear to what extent people are aware of the ``hidden costs'' of such policies. For instance, fuel economy standards in the US have been estimated as three to six times more costly than a tax on gasoline for similar abatement levels \citep{jacobsen_2013}. In addition to their efficiency costs, these standards are also regressive, possibly more than gasoline taxes \citep{jacobsen_2013, davis_knittel_2019, levinson_2019}. The exact properties of these instruments are of course specific to their design, but it is likely that their popularity partly reflects the underestimation of their costs.

The comparison between standards and price instruments for urban transport policies confirms the preference for the former. While the prohibition of polluting vehicles in city centers comes fourth in the list of preferred options with 44\% approval, the introduction of urban tolls comes last with only 14\%. In a survey on urban road pricing, \citet{jones_1998} identifies the main deterrent for these mechanisms. If some are specific to congestion charges, the other perceived problems are very much alike those identified for our Tax \& dividend: ineffectiveness, unfairness and feeling that this is just another tax.

        \subsubsection{Diesel taxation}

\begin{figure}[b]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{Images/diesel_catch_up_trim.png}
\caption{Approval of a catch-up of diesel taxes.}
\label{fig:diesel}
\end{figure}

The strong opposition of the Yellow Vests against energy taxes did not only lead the government to reverse the planned carbon tax trajectory. The additional tax increases initially scheduled for diesel --- to catch-up with the currently higher rates imposed on gasoline despite diesel's high social cost from air pollution  --- have also been abandoned.\footnote{Three increases of +0.026\euro{}/L were initially scheduled for January 2019, 2020 and 2021.}  In our survey, we therefore ask respondents whether they would accept an increase in diesel taxes to catch-up with gasoline. As illustrated by Figure \ref{fig:diesel}, 59\% of respondents answer they would not, while 29\% say they would (12\% ``PNR''). Among the 57\% of households who own a diesel vehicle, the opposition goes up to 80\%. The geographic difference is also striking as 73\% of rural households would be opposed, against only 40\% of those living in the Paris agglomeration. As shown in our online Appendix, these two determinants persist when controlling for many other criteria and clearly appear, together with political orientation, as the most important divides with respect to diesel taxation.

% The additional tax increases initially scheduled for diesel (+0.026\euro{}/L) have also been abandoned. Diesel price was indeed supposed to rise more rapidly, in order to progressively catch-up with the currently higher tax imposed on gasoline. This historical advantage was considered by the government as a bad signal given the social costs of diesel from air pollution.

        \subsubsection{Shale gas exploitation}

The energy transition implies a shift away from fossil fuels, but it is sometimes argued that, at least in the short run, a substitution from coal to shale gas would reduce emissions as the former pollutes less than the later. As France holds among the largest reserves of shale gas in Europe, its exploitation could be exported and \textit{possibly} substitute for more carbon intensive energies.\footnote{See \citet{eia_shale_2013} for an assessment of recoverable reserves, and \citet{saussey_2018} for a nuanced view on the prospects for such exploitation in France.} Before asking for approval over shale gas exploitation, we first face respondents with a trade-off between the possible climate benefits relative to coal, and the potential negative effects on water quality at the local level. Then, using respondents' zipcode, we inform them whether their department would possibly be concerned or not by shale gas exploitation.\footnote{Source: exploitation and exploration permits, and exploration permit applications in 2011, as reported by \hyperlink{http://www.lefigaro.fr/societes/2011/10/04/04015-20111004ARTFIG00465-gaz-de-schiste-total-veut-des-explications.php}{Le Figaro}. Original source is \hyperlink{http://www.minergies.fr/fr/cartographie}{Direction Générale de l'Énergie et du Climat}, but the archive is not accessible.} Over all respondents, 59\% declare being opposed to exploitation, while 16\% are in favor. As shown in our online Appendix, acceptance (defined as approval or ``PNR'') appears lower by 5 p.p. \textit{ceteris paribus} when the department is not concerned. When asked about the main benefit of shale gas exploitation, 26\% answer it would ``create jobs and boost employment in the departments concerned'', 18\% that it would limit climate change, and none of these reasons for the other 56\%. Finally, 25\% of respondents think it is valid to say that shale gas exploitation would limit climate change, as ``any decrease in emissions goes in the right direction'', while 43\% think it is not, as ``emissions should be stopped, not just slowed down''.
% Among those favorable to exploitation, 48\% invoke job creation, 48\% climate change and 4\% are favorable for other reasons.

\section{Determinants of Attitudes\label{sec:determinants}}

To understand what factors foster environmentally-friendly attitudes, we explore the socio-demographic determinants of attitudes over CC, the correlations between knowledge and perception of CC, and how these attitudes over CC as well as socio-demographics shape preferences for policies. 

    \subsection{Attitudes over climate change}\label{sec:determinants_attitudes_CC}

Table \ref{tab:determinants_attitudes_CC} shows the main socio-demographic determinants of different attitudes towards CC: the knowledge that CC is anthropic (columns 1-3), an index of knowledge over CC (4) and the perception that CC is ``disastrous'' or ``cataclysmic'' (5-6). To build the index of knowledge, we first compute a score for the question asking the emission target p.c. required to limit CC (see section \ref{subsec:knowledge}). With $t$ the respondent's answer (from 0 to 10 tCO$_2$/yr), we define the score as:

\begin{equation}
\textnormal{score emission target}=\begin{cases}
3 & \text{if }t\leq2\\
2 & \text{if }t\in\left[3;4\right]\\
1 & \text{if }t\in\left[5;6\right]\\
0 & \text{if }t\geq7
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

and we then aggregate this score with other answers:

\begin{align}
\textnormal{knowledge}= & \textnormal{ score factors}+\textnormal{score emission target} \nonumber\\
 & +3\cdot\left(\textnormal{CC anthropic}-\textnormal{CC doesn't exist}\right) \nonumber \\
 & +\textnormal{India most affected} \label{eq:knowledge2}
\end{align}

where ``score factors'' is the sum of correct answers to factors of CC (see Figure \ref{fig:factors}); and the remaining variables in the formula are dummies. The original index ranges from $-$3 (no respondent) to +13 (22 respondents), and has quartiles of 6, 8 and 9. In the following, we normalize this index by subtracting the mean (7.6) and dividing by the standard deviation (2.5). Finally, we run OLS regressions of our three attitudes over CC on various socio-demographics, household characteristics and political orientation. We report only the most relevant variables, but describe the entire list of covariates in Appendix \ref{app:covariates}. We confirm that logistic regressions yield similar results (see online Appendix).

%plays a ``pro-climate'' role, though a less important one
The best predictors of attitudes over CC belong to the political orientation, and in particular the identification to ecologists, the positioning towards the Yellow Vests and the left-right leaning. Political orientation shapes different attitudes in a consistent manner: being ecologist, more left-wing or less supportive of the Yellow Vests is always associated with better knowledge and higher pessimism. Interest into politics (measured on a scale ``almost not''/``a little''/``a lot'') also leads to higher ``concern over CC'', but to a lesser extent. Two observations on the left-right leaning deserve comment. First, the 40\% of people indeterminate relative to this cleavage (see Appendix \ref{app:stats_des} for the descriptive statistics) have attitudes close to the center-right. Second, the variations predicted in the dependent variables are as high across the Yellow Vests positionings than across the traditional left-right spectrum. For instance, knowledge on CC is \textit{ceteris paribus} lower by 0.52 standard deviation (s.d.) for people part of the movement than for those who oppose it, which is comparable to the spread of 0.39 s.d. between extreme-right and extreme-left people (4). 

Two socio-demographics are also consistently related to attitudes over CC: age and level of education. In general, the younger and the more educated, the more people are concerned by CC. People aged 18-24 may appear to have slightly lower knowledge and lower pessimism than people of prime age other things equal, in columns (1,4,5), but this is because their concerned attitudes are mostly captured by the employment status modality ``student'', not shown in the table. Overall, generations with the least concerned attitudes are undeniably those over 65 years old. For instance, without any control, they are 20 percentage points (p.p.) less likely to believe that CC is anthropic than young adults (2) --- though most of this effect is explained by a lower level of education (1). Another finding is that men have a higher knowledge than women by 0.15 s.d. \textit{ceteris paribus} (4), but their perception of severity of CC is virtually the same (5). Finally, other characteristics have smaller or even insignificant effects. 

Although the determinants we find are broadly consistent with those elicited in the literature \citep{upham_public_2009,whitmarsh_scepticism_2011, ademe_representations_2018},\footnote{See also \citet{capstick_international_2015} for trends in attitudes.} we do not retrieve the political polarity which characterizes the United States. Indeed, \citet{kahan_polarizing_2012} argue that American people ``tend to form perceptions of societal risks that cohere with values characteristic of groups with which they identify'' (this is the cultural cognition thesis), rather than through an assessment of the scientific evidence they encounter (the science comprehension thesis). It is crucial to know whether people neglect climate science in such a way, as this would mean that media campaign would have little effects on people's assimilation of climate science. \citet{kahan_polarizing_2012} and \citet{mccright_politicization_2011} provide evidence for cultural cognition by showing that education has little effect on perceived risk or on knowledge of CC, while the interaction between education and political orientation has.\footnote{\citet{funk_politics_2016} also report that Republicans are equally distrustful of climate scientists' integrity whatever their level of education, while the distrust vanishes for Democrats with higher degrees. The mechanism of the interaction is documented by \citet{ehret_partisan_2018} and \citet{van_boven_psychological_2018}: people form beliefs through partisan cues, by adopting views expressed by political figures of the party they identify and rejecting positions from the other party.} We assess whether such interaction appears in the French context, by studying the interaction between the higher degree obtained and the left-right political leaning (columns 4, 6). We find no significant interaction, and obtain the same nil result when replacing the traditional left-right scale by the Yellow Vests positioning, and/or (in 6) the higher degree by knowledge on CC. This lack of evidence suggests that the public debate over CC is less polarized in France than in the US, and that the knowledge and perception of many French people could change, had they access to better information over CC.

%Although the determinants we find are broadly consistent with those elicited in the literature \citep{whitmarsh_scepticism_2011, ademe_representations_2018}, we do not retrieve the political polarity which characterizes the United States. Indeed, a series of paper have shown that not only do the American political cleavage translate into sharp contrasts in attitudes over CC, but that the cleavage also determines how other factors shape these attitudes. \citet{kahan_polarizing_2012} argue that American people ``tend to form perceptions of societal risks that cohere with values characteristic of groups with which they identify'' (this is the cultural cognition thesis), rather than through an assessment of the scientific evidence they encounter (the science comprehension thesis). It is crucial to know whether people neglect climate science in such a way, as this would mean that media campaign would have little effects on people's assimilation of climate science. \citet{kahan_polarizing_2012} and \citet{mccright_politicization_2011} provide evidence for the cultural cognition thesis using similar methods: they show that education has little effect on perceived risk or on knowledge of CC, while the interaction between education and political orientation has. \citet{funk_politics_2016} also report that Republicans are equally distrustful of climate scientists' integrity whatever their level of education, while the distrust vanishes for Democrats with higher degrees. The mechanism of the interaction is documented by \citet{ehret_partisan_2018} and \citet{van_boven_psychological_2018}: people form beliefs through partisan cues, by adopting views expressed by political figures of the party they identify and rejecting positions from the other party. We assess whether such interaction appears in the French context, by studying the interaction between the higher degree obtained and the left-right political leaning (columns 4, 6). We find no significant interaction, and obtain the same nil result when replacing the traditional left-right scale by the Yellow Vests positioning, and/or (in 6) the higher degree by knowledge on CC. This lack of evidence suggests that the public debate over CC is less polarized in France than in the US, and that the knowledge and perception of many French people could change, had they access to better information over CC. 
% Although people of both parties may have comparable underlying beliefs on what the scientific consensus affirms, whose correctness increase with their education \citep{kahan_climate-science_2015}, the position they defend socially is in fact determined by the polarity between the left and the right over climate issues, and they adopt the scientific consensus only when it coheres with their partisan identity. 

% cite Capstick et al. 2015 on polarization and Brulle et al 2012 on factors of concern in CC: economic factors and elite cues there has been growing political polarization in the United States, with right‐of‐center voters growing increasingly skeptical, compared to left‐of‐center voters. This is consistent with pervasive ‘confirmation bias’ (the propensity to seek out and believe information that confirms existing views140) and interest‐based efforts to shape public opinion. Capstick et al. 2015

Figure \ref{fig:correlations} gives a sense of the shift in perception and in support for climate policies that could follow an information campaign, as it shows the correlations between attitudes over CC, climate policies and socio-demographics. Knowledge is highly correlated with perceived gravity (correlation of 0.43), and both of these variables are in turn well correlated with the readiness to adopt an ecological lifestyle and to the number of climate policies (of Figure \ref{fig:policies}) supported (correlations around 0.3). The acceptance of Tax \& dividend is less correlated with attitudes (at 0.1-0.2), as the support for this policy is already low. Still, the positive correlation between knowledge and support for other climate policies is encouraging for the prospect of an information campaign over CC, even more so that we did not find evidence that partisanship would lead some people to dismiss scientific discourse. Finally, as previously seen, diploma and age are quite correlated with attitudes, though theses correlations are below those between attitudes over CC and over policies, at 0 to 0.2.

    \subsection{Attitudes over policies}\label{sec:determinants_attitudes_policies}

%In section \ref{sec:attitudes_carbon_tax} and \ref{sec:attitudes_other_policies} we have described how people respond on average to various environmental policies.
To better understand the heterogeneity in people's support, we regress several indicators of attitudes towards climate policies on respondents' characteristics. Table \ref{tab:politiques_env} reports the results for the acceptance of our Tax \& dividend (columns 1-2) and the readiness to adopt an ecological lifestyle (6) in the case the richest were contributing, efforts were shared globally, and alternatives were developed. We also use the eight policies proposed in Figure \ref{fig:policies} in our dependent variables: column 3 studies the share of policies approved, while column 4 features the preference for norms vs. taxes within the policies. Similarly, column 5 uses six measures of Figure \ref{fig:recycling} to define an index of preference for earmarking vs. transfers. Indexes for these preferences are constructed as follows:

\begin{align}
\textnormal{Norms vs. taxes} = \sum_{p \in \textnormal{norms}} \textnormal{score}_{p} - \sum_{p \in \textnormal{taxes}}  \textnormal{score}_{p}
\label{eq:norms_vs_taxes}
\end{align}

\noindent
where the score of each measure corresponds to a grade between $-$2 (for a ``Not at all'' answer) and 2 (for ``Yes, completely''). We proceed similarly for earmarking vs. transfers, and describe the categorization of measures in Appendix \ref{app:measures}. Again, we normalize these two indexes by subtracting the mean (2.8 for norms vs. taxes, 1.4 for earmarking vs. transfers) and dividing by the standard deviation (3.3 and 3.1 respectively).

\end{table*} 

As suggested by the correlation matrix of section \ref{sec:determinants_attitudes_CC}, knowledge on CC and the conviction that it would be disastrous positively affect the approval of climate policies, \textit{ceteris paribus}. Excluding the (endogenous) variables describing political orientation, an increase in knowledge by 1 s.d. would induce a lower likelihood to reject Tax \& dividend by 5 p.p. (column 2). The effect of these variables is even stronger when considering the share of policies approved: controlling for socio-demographics, an increase in knowledge by 1 s.d. is associated with an additional approval of 6 p.p. while the conviction that CC is disastrous increases it by 9 p.p. (see online Appendix). Beyond the strong correlation we previously found, these results clearly show that increasing climate awareness would significantly increase the support for climate policies.

%  This result confirms previous evidence from other countries, such as \citet{thalmann_public_2004} and \citet{bornstein_lanz_2008} in Switzerland.
Besides attitudes over CC, the two most critical determinants appear to be the positioning towards ecologists and towards the Yellow Vests. Everything else equal, ecologists are more likely to accept Tax \& dividend by 13 p.p., and more willing to approve other environmental policies by about 8 p.p. Conversely, holding other variables constant, people supporting the Yellow Vests are 22 p.p. more likely to reject Tax \& dividend relative to people opposed to the movement. As shown by column 3, higher affinity with the Yellow Vests is also associated with less support for other climate policies. Ecologists being more favorable to environmental taxes, their relative preference for norms vs. taxes is lower than for other respondents. Ecologists also display a higher relative preference for earmarking, consistent with a will to increase environmental spending in general. Oppositely, because Yellow Vests supporters are overall less likely to accept environmental policies including norms, their relative preference for norms against taxes is lower than average. They also have a higher relative preference for transfers against earmarking compared to other households, consistent with a lower willingness to pay to protect the environment and/or bigger concerns for purchasing power. Finally, ecologists' attitude towards environmental policies translate into a higher willingness to adopt an ecological lifestyle (by 15 p.p.), but the opposite does not hold for the Yellow Vests, who are not significantly less ready to adopt an ecological lifestyle. Although this could signal some warm glow, it also suggests that their strong rejection of environmental policies does not simply follows from lower concerns about the environment. The situation of fairness embedded in our question could be critical if Yellow Vests are to accept sacrifices. Their rejection could also reflect a deeper rejection of policies in general, due to a high distrust in governments --- documented in \citet{algan_et_al_19}. This interpretation echoes a large literature on the importance of trust for climate policies' support, as reviewed in \citet{drews_van_der_bergh_2016}. 

%Although this could to some extent reflect warm glow, it also suggests that their strong rejection of environmental policies does not simply follows from lower concerns about the environment: it could also translate a deeper rejection of policies in general, due to a high distrust in governments --- documented for instance in \citet{algan_et_al_19} --- as well as the necessity to meet the conditions mentioned in this question, in particular the sharing of efforts, the contribution of the richest and the development of alternatives.

A clear message from Table \ref{tab:politiques_env} is that the standard left-right spectrum is little relevant to understand attitudes towards environmental policies. None of our five left-right dummy variables are significantly correlated with the share of policies approved. With respect to Tax \& dividend, the only significant effect is for the extreme-left, with a positive coefficient of 0.11 which partly compensates for the higher share of people supporting the Yellow Vests in this category (63\% support or are part), and whose attitude towards the environment might differ from other supporters of the movement. This result somewhat contrasts with the literature which has shown evidence of a larger support of climate policies from people at the left of the political spectrum \citep[see][for a review]{drews_van_der_bergh_2016}. Without controlling for other variables, we find that people most likely to accept Tax \& dividend in France are the ones affiliated to the center (+9 p.p. relative to ``Indeterminate''), and the less likely are those at the extreme-right (-15 p.p.), which may be driven by the support or rejection of the current government, who tried to increase the carbon tax. Our results also show that people at the extreme-left and at the center are the most likely to approve other environmental policies (+7 p.p.), the less likely being those at the extreme-right ($-$6 p.p.). Still, these differences become small and not statistically significant when covariates are included.

% DONE: Comme dit plus haut, peut-être davantage exploiter l'effet de la connaissance si notre "policy recommendation" c'est une campagne d'information sur le climat. Donner les résultats pour une même régression juste avec cette variable et les socio-démo (pas les autres variables relevant du choix). => oui

Besides political attitudes, we also observe heterogeneity in people's response along socio-demographic characteristics. As in attitudes over CC, age plays a role, as 18-24 are about 10 p.p. more likely to accept Tax \& dividend (column 2). Still, controlling for knowledge, political attitudes and other variables, this effect is reduced by half. Similarly, more educated people tend to be more favorable to environmental policies \citep[as previously found by][]{thalmann_public_2004}, but this effect becomes insignificant once age dummies are included as covariates. Furthermore, we find little effect of income on attitudes towards climate policies, a result that confirms that of \citet{thalmann_public_2004} from Switzerland. Using our full set of controls, the most significant variables differ from the main factors of attitudes over CC: these significant variables are the size of town \citep[city dwellers being more favorable to environmental policies, as in][]{thalmann_public_2004}, and sex (males being less favorable). Although men have on average a higher knowledge over CC than women, this does not translate into higher pessimism (see section \ref{sec:determinants_attitudes_CC}), and it even coincides with lower support for climate policies. This phenomenon is consistent with the findings of \citet{stern_value_1993} and \citet{hampel_gender_1996} that women are more attentive to links between the environment and things they value, even if they share the same values and beliefs as men. Difference in perception of the impact on oneself could thus explain the higher support of women for climate policies, even for a lower factual knowledge.

% This shows that, despite the positive correlation between knowledge and support for policies, the latter has its own determinants, which may act on the opposite direction than with the former. The most compelling case is that of sex: although men have on average a higher knowledge over CC than women, this does not translate into higher pessimism

%Previous studies have examined the factors explaining differences in attitudes towards environmental policies. \citet{stern_value_1993} find that women --- from a sample of college students --- are more likely to believe they can be harmed by environmental problems, but the value they assign to these beliefs does not significantly differ from men. Difference in beliefs with respect to the impact on oneself could thus explain the higher willingness of women to accept environmental policies. \citet{thalmann_public_2004} shows that people living in larger municipalities and with higher education are more favorable to carbon taxation in Switzerland, but he finds no significant relation with income. Our results confirm his findings on the income and geographical dimensions for France. Once controlled for age, we find however no evidence of a positive effect of diploma, although knowledge about CC significantly increases the chances to accept Tax \& dividend and other environmental policies.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

Despite a social movement against the carbon tax, French people appear mostly aware and concerned about climate change. Their rejection should therefore not be taken as a low willingness to act for the environment, but rather as a perceived inadequacy between current carbon taxation and the fight for climate. As shown in our companion paper \citet{douenne_can_2019}, people's beliefs about carbon taxation are largely biased, and these biases are well anchored, making it unlikely that carbon taxation be peacefully reintroduced in the short-run. 

Thus, our survey suggests the following pathway for successful reforms. First and foremost, a massive and long-lasting information campaign could be launched to improve knowledge about climate change and climate policies. Indeed, higher knowledge is clearly associated with higher concern for CC and higher support for climate policies. Second, as people favor most the policies that provide alternatives to fossil fuels, the government could develop such policies as a substitute to a carbon tax: investments, subsidies and regulations in favor of public transport, cleaner vehicles and thermal insulation, etc. Last but not least, a more cost-effective carbon tax may later complement these policies, as people should get convinced by the objective of carbon neutrality and by the government's commitment towards this goal. 

More generally, market imperfections, distributive effects and political acceptability concerns call for a combination of different types of climate policies rather than a single price signal \citep{stern_report_2017,stiglitz_addressing_2019}. Furthermore, to successfully introduce a carbon tax, it is important to build public trust in politicians \citep{harring_jagers_2013} and to correct the inequities of the tax. Sweden was the first country to introduce a carbon tax, and it is no coincidence if political trust is among the highest \citep{klenert_making_2018} and if the 1991 Swedish tax was part of a comprehensive restructuring of the tax system, the popular ``reform of the century'' \citep{sterner_environmental_2014}. A last takeaway of the Swedish example is that a dialogue with all stakeholders can help building a consensus and finding fair solutions, and may be key to decarbonization.

%More generally, we may take example upon Sweden, which was the first country to introduce a carbon tax: public trust in politicians is among the highest \citep{harring_jagers_2013,klenert_making_2018}, and the 1991 tax was part of a comprehensive restructuring of the tax system, the popular ``reform of the century'' \citep{sterner_environmental_2014}. Finally, shaping a consistent transition through a dialogue with all stakeholders may be the last key to reproduce Sweden's success in decarbonizing.

\section{Sources on GhG emissions\label{app:sources}}

\subsection{Carbon footprints\label{app:footprint}}

\paragraph{Plane vs. train}

Given that French electricity mix is decarbonized at 93\%\footnote{Cf. \hyperlink{https://www.rte-france.com/sites/default/files/be_pdf_2018v3.pdf}{RTE - Bilan électrique 2018} (p. 32).}, the carbon footprint of highspeed train is actually more than 20 times lower than that of an interior flight of the same distance. Hence, we chose Bordeaux - Nice as our case study as the train connection makes a big detour by Paris. Thus, we obtain an emission of 10 kg of CO$_\textnormal{2}$ by train as compared to 180 kg by plane. Our source for train is the French railroad company, \hyperlink{https://www.oui.sncf/aide/calcul-des-emissions-de-co2-sur-votre-trajet-en-train}{SNCF}, and is consistent with data aggregated by the official agency \hyperlink{basecarbone.fr}{ADEME}. For the flight, our source is a  \hyperlink{https://calculator.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx?tab=3}{carbon footprint calculator}. \hyperlink{http://www.climatecare.org/home.aspx}{Another calculator} provides almost the same result, so we preferred this figure rather than a higher figure from a \hyperlink{https://co2.myclimate.org/fr/flight_calculators}{third calculator}.

\paragraph{Nuclear vs. wind}

AR5 from \citet{ar5_ar5_nodate} and \citet{pehl_understanding_2017} show that nuclear power plants and wind turbines have similar carbon footprint, at 10 gCO$_\textnormal{2}$eq$/$kWh (for comparison, it is 500 for gas combined cycle).

\paragraph{Beef vs. pasta}

\citet{poore_reducing_2018} show that median beef carbon footprint is 60 kgCO$_\textnormal{2}$eq$/$kg (more precisely, 30 kgCO$_\textnormal{2}$eq per 100g of protein and 200g of protein per kg); while the carbon footprint of wheat pasta is 1.3 kgCO$_\textnormal{2}$eq$/$kg (0.5 kgCO$_\textnormal{2}$eq per 1000 kcal of protein and 2695 kcal per kg). Given that a beef steak \hyperlink{http://www.lessentieldesviandes-pro.org/introduction.php}{weighs 100-125g}, its carbon footprint is twenty times that of two servings of pasta of 125g each. 

\subsection{Current and target emissions\label{app:emission}}

French consumption-based yearly GhG emissions amounted in 2014 to 712 MtCO$_\textnormal{2}$eq, i.e. 10.8 tCO$_\textnormal{2}$eq p.c., and are roughly stable in recent years \citep{cgdd_chiffres_2019}. To stop climate change and stabilize the GhG concentration in the atmosphere, it is required to meet zero net emissions. To meet the Paris agreement,  \hyperlink{https://www.ecologique-solidaire.gouv.fr/strategie-nationale-bas-carbone-snbc}{France National Low-Carbon Strategy} aims to achieve carbon (i.e. GhG) neutrality by 2050 \citep{ministry_of_ecology_france_2015}. Given carbon sinks estimated at 85 Mt$_\textnormal{2}$eq for 2050 (mainly forest and soil), this strategy requires to reach gross emissions of about 1 tCO$_\textnormal{2}$eq p.c. at this date. Admittedly, less stringent scenarios may still allow to keep global warming below +2\textdegree{}C in 2100 with good probability --- even considering the same burden share for France --- by relying more heavily on net negative emissions after 2070 through carbon capture and storage. For this reason, we consider a range of answers as correct for the French target emission in 2050: from 0 to 2 tCO$_\textnormal{2}$eq p.c.

(Don't know, don't say) }
\item In your opinion, climate change... \emph{}\\
\emph{is not a reality; is mainly due to natural climate variability;
is mainly due to human activity; PNR (Don't know, don't say). }
\item Which of the following elements contribute to global warming? (Several
answers possible) \emph{}\\
\emph{CO$_{2}$; Methane; Oxygen; Particulate matter}
\item In your opinion, which of the following statements are true? (Several
answers possible). \emph{}\\
\emph{Consuming one beef steak emits about 20 times more greenhouse
gases than eating two servings of pasta.; Electricity produced by
nuclear power emits about 20 times more greenhouse gases than electricity
produced by wind turbines.; A seat in a Bordeaux - Nice journey emits
about 20 times more greenhouse gases by plane than by high speed train. }
\item In your opinion, how would the effects of climate change be, if humanity
did nothing to limit it? \emph{}\\
\emph{Insignificant, or even beneficial; Small, because humans would
be able to live with it; Grave, because there would be more natural
disasters; Disastrous, lifestyles would be largely altered; Cataclysmic,
humankind would disappear; PNR(Don't know, don't say) }
\item In which of these two regions do you think will climate change have
the worst consequences? \emph{}\\
\emph{The European Union; India; As much in both }
\item In your opinion, in France, which generations will be seriously affected
by climate change? (Several answers possible) \emph{}\\
\emph{People born in the 1960s; People born in the 1990s; People born
in the 2020s; People born in the 2050s; None of the four }
\item In your opinion, who is responsible for climate change? (Several possible
choices) \emph{}\\
\emph{Each of us; The richest; Governments; Some foreign countries;
Past generations; Natural causes }
\item Currently, each French person emits on average the equivalent of 10
tons of CO$_{2}$ per year. \\
\\
In your opinion, how much must this figure be reduced to by 2050 in
order to hope to contain global warming to +2°C in 2100 (if all countries
did the same)? In 2050, we should emit at most... \emph{}\\
\emph{0; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10} tons 
\item Has climate change had or will it have an influence on your decision
to make a child (or children)?\emph{ }\\
\emph{Yes; No; PNR (Don't know, don't say)}
\item {[}If \emph{Yes}{]} Why does climate change influence your decision
to have a child (or children)? (Several answers possible). \emph{}\\
\emph{Because I don't want my child to live in a devastated world.;
Because each additional human being aggravates climate change.}
\item Would you be willing to change your lifestyle to fight climate change?
(Several answers possible) \emph{}\\
\emph{Yes, if policies went in this direction; Yes, if I had the financial
means; Yes, if everyone did the same; No, only the richest people
have to change their way of life; No, it is against my personal interest;
No, I think climate change is not a real problem; I have already adopted
a sustainable way of life; I try, but I have trouble changing my habits} 
\item Assuming that all states in the world agree to firmly fight climate
change, notably through a transition to renewable energy, by making the richest contribute, and imagining that France would expand the
supply of non-polluting transport very widely; would you be willing
to adopt an ecological lifestyle (i.e. eat little red meat and ensure
to use almost no gasoline, diesel or kerosene)? \emph{}\\
\emph{Yes; No; PNR (Don't know, don't say) }
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Shale gas (and smoking)}
\begin{enumerate}[resume,leftmargin=*]
\item Do you smoke regularly? \emph{Yes; No }
\item The use of shale gas would limit climate change, as gas would be exported
and used to produce electricity instead of coal. On the other hand,
extraction would risk reducing water quality at the local level. Your
department {[}would possibly be / would not be{]} concerned by the exploitation
of shale gas. \\
\\
In view of this information, would you be in favor of shale gas exploitation
in France? \emph{}\\
\emph{Yes; No; PNR (Don't know, don't say) }
\item What would be the main benefit to you from shale gas development?
\emph{}\\
\emph{This would limit climate change; This would create jobs and
boost the department; None of these two reasons }
\item What do you think of the idea that shale gas would limit climate change?
\emph{}\\
\emph{It is valid: any decrease in emissions goes in the right direction;
It is unwelcome: emissions should be stopped, not just slowed down;
PNR(Don't know, don't say) }
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Access to public transport and mobility habits}
\begin{enumerate}[resume,leftmargin=*]
\item How many minutes walk is it to the nearest public transit stop? (To
simplify, you can use the conversion 1 km = 10 min walk). \emph{}\\
\emph{in min:} ; \emph{PNR (Don't know, don't say) }
\item How often does the nearest public transport pass? (excluding school
buses) \emph{}\\
\emph{Less than three times a day; Between four times a day and once
an hour; Once or twice an hour; More than three times an hour; PNR
(Don't know, don't say) }
\item What do you think about the availability of public transport where
you live? It is... \emph{}\\
\emph{Satisfactory; Suitable, but should be increased; Limited, but
sufficient; Insufficient; PNR (Don't know, don't say) }

using public transport? \emph{}\\
\emph{Yes, it would not be very difficult for me; Yes, but it would
bother me; No; PNR (Don't know, don't say) }
